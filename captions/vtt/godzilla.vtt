00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:47.639
Andrew!

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.712
Andrew!

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.551
Andrew!

00:01:00.553 --> 00:01:03.389
No!

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.426
Andrew!

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.702
No!

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:40.925
<i>Thousands gathered</i>

00:01:40.927 --> 00:01:42.458
<i>in the Bay Area last night</i>

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.761
<i>to honor the victims
of the 2014 attacks.</i>

00:01:45.763 --> 00:01:48.464
<i>Part of a wave
of memorials and protests</i>

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:51.901
<i>demanding that the secretive
monster-hunting coalition</i>

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.336
<i>known as Monarch
be held accountable.</i>

00:01:54.338 --> 00:01:56.607
<i>The recent spike
in mass die-offs</i>

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:58.407
<i>in the world's oceans</i>

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.943
<i>could be caused by efforts
to locate and track Godzilla,</i>

00:02:00.945 --> 00:02:03.514
<i>who hasn't been seen
in over five years.</i>

00:02:03.516 --> 00:02:06.250
<i>Top brass at the mysterious
Monarch organization</i>

00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:07.917
<i>will face
another intense grilling</i>

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.820
<i>as the government continues</i>

00:02:09.822 --> 00:02:12.222
<i>to push for extermination
of the Titans.</i>

00:02:12.224 --> 00:02:14.592
<i>And rumors persist
that Monarch may be hiding</i>

00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:18.462
<i>even more creatures discovered
since the attacks of 2014.</i>

00:02:18.464 --> 00:02:20.664
<i>A historic tragedy
that changed the world</i>

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:22.332
<i>as we know it forever.</i>

00:02:22.334 --> 00:02:26.672
<i>The day the world discovered
that monsters are real.</i>

00:02:58.437 --> 00:03:00.837
Shit!

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.575
Shit, shit, shit!

00:03:04.577 --> 00:03:05.809
- Oh...
- Maddie?

00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:06.976
Good morning!

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:08.979
- Good morning, Mom!
- Oh, God!

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:10.279
- Uh...
- Okay.

00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:14.752
I made us breakfast.

00:03:14.754 --> 00:03:16.720
It's, uh...

00:03:16.722 --> 00:03:19.892
Eggs, toast,
and what was once bacon.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.093
And which do you recommend?

00:03:23.095 --> 00:03:24.796
The toast and eggs.

00:03:25.798 --> 00:03:27.267
Thank you.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:31.803
Coffee?

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.873
What were you working on?

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:38.944
Um, I was looking at recipes.

00:03:39.512 --> 00:03:41.014
For toast?

00:03:43.782 --> 00:03:46.283
Dad's been emailing me.

00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:47.617
But he looks good.

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:48.887
Healthy.

00:03:51.256 --> 00:03:52.422
Have you responded?

00:03:52.424 --> 00:03:53.891
Not yet.

00:03:53.893 --> 00:03:55.625
Madison, I just don't want to
see you get hurt.

00:03:55.627 --> 00:03:57.226
I know.

00:03:57.228 --> 00:03:58.628
Especially with everything
that's going on right now.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.099
Mom, I know.

00:04:04.236 --> 00:04:07.771
Listen, I know things
haven't been easy for you.

00:04:07.773 --> 00:04:10.140
But we're gonna
get through this.

00:04:10.142 --> 00:04:11.675
Together.

00:04:11.677 --> 00:04:14.010
You sure he's gonna be okay?

00:04:14.012 --> 00:04:17.816
He is in the safest place
that he could be right now.

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:21.286
You wanna hear some good news?

00:04:22.854 --> 00:04:24.621
I finished it.

00:04:24.623 --> 00:04:26.159
Really?

00:04:28.426 --> 00:04:30.626
You think it's gonna work?

00:04:30.628 --> 00:04:32.628
It's gonna work.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.189
It's gonna be okay.

00:04:57.822 --> 00:04:58.955
<i>Doctor Russell,</i>

00:04:58.957 --> 00:05:00.692
<i>we need you in Containment.</i>

00:05:01.793 --> 00:05:03.760
I'm on my way.

00:05:15.574 --> 00:05:16.707
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:17.840
No idea.

00:05:17.842 --> 00:05:19.142
She was sleeping like a baby

00:05:19.144 --> 00:05:20.577
until an hour ago,
and then, boom.

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:22.111
Her radiation levels
went through the roof.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.681
Almost like
something triggered it.

00:05:23.683 --> 00:05:25.214
Thanks, Tim.

00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:26.817
I can take it from here.
Why don't you get some rest?

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.217
No way.

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.356
Sleep or no sleep,
I'm not missing this.

00:05:43.902 --> 00:05:47.236
<i>Containment team,
move into primary position.</i>

00:05:48.574 --> 00:05:50.474
- Sedatives?
- No effect.

00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:52.812
This thing wants to be born.

00:05:55.113 --> 00:05:57.613
<i>Emergency protocol
is in effect.</i>

00:05:57.615 --> 00:05:59.616
<i>Ten seconds to biocontainment.</i>

00:05:59.618 --> 00:06:01.687
Her time has come.

00:06:29.548 --> 00:06:31.847
Meet <i>Titanus mosura.</i>

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:33.349
Or as we like to call her...

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.784
Mothra.

00:06:34.786 --> 00:06:36.553
Incredible.

00:06:36.555 --> 00:06:39.123
<i>Activating containment grid.</i>

00:06:47.565 --> 00:06:49.034
- <i>Warning.</i>
- What's happening?

00:06:52.171 --> 00:06:53.503
<i>Warning.</i>

00:06:53.505 --> 00:06:54.972
Something's really wrong here.

00:06:54.974 --> 00:06:56.373
Containment systems
are failing.

00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:57.875
Perimeter alarms
are going off,

00:06:57.877 --> 00:06:59.308
the whole network's
going insane.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.911
What do you mean?
How is that possible?

00:07:00.913 --> 00:07:02.381
Emma, I think someone else
is doing this.

00:07:06.685 --> 00:07:08.351
<i>Containment team, stand down.</i>

00:07:08.353 --> 00:07:10.423
I repeat, stand down.
You are scaring her.

00:07:36.548 --> 00:07:38.114
No!

00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:39.082
Doctor Russell, I'm sorry.
But you know the protocols.

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:40.351
We have to terminate!

00:07:40.353 --> 00:07:41.353
I'll handle this.

00:07:43.454 --> 00:07:44.555
Mom! No!

00:07:44.557 --> 00:07:46.526
Madison, stay here.
It's gonna work.

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:52.498
<i>Stand clear.</i>

00:07:59.505 --> 00:08:01.307
It's okay.

00:08:39.277 --> 00:08:40.345
Mom!

00:08:46.819 --> 00:08:48.919
Mom!

00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:50.486
Maddie, wait!

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.555
Maddie!

00:08:52.557 --> 00:08:53.892
Get back in here!

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.395
Maddie! Go back!

00:08:58.863 --> 00:09:00.099
Mom! Let's go!

00:09:03.268 --> 00:09:04.269
Mom!

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.804
Son of a bitch.

00:09:41.806 --> 00:09:44.142
It worked.

00:10:40.465 --> 00:10:41.700
Mom?

00:10:56.047 --> 00:10:58.981
What we are witnessing here,
Senators,

00:10:58.983 --> 00:11:03.886
is the return of an ancient
and forgotten super species.

00:11:03.888 --> 00:11:07.491
Godzilla, the MUTOs, Kong.

00:11:07.493 --> 00:11:10.260
We believe that these "Titans"

00:11:10.262 --> 00:11:11.693
and others like them

00:11:11.695 --> 00:11:14.231
provide an essential balance
to our world.

00:11:14.233 --> 00:11:16.232
And while some may
pose a threat,

00:11:16.234 --> 00:11:19.602
Monarch is uniquely prepared
to determine

00:11:19.604 --> 00:11:22.371
which of these Titans are here
to threaten us

00:11:22.373 --> 00:11:25.475
and which of these Titans
are here to protect us.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.943
Thank you for the fifth grade
history lesson, Mr. Coleman.

00:11:27.945 --> 00:11:30.847
But we still haven't heard
one good reason

00:11:30.849 --> 00:11:33.850
why Monarch shouldn't fall
under military jurisdiction.

00:11:33.852 --> 00:11:36.885
Or why these creatures
shouldn't be exterminated.

00:11:36.887 --> 00:11:38.554
Monarch was tasked

00:11:38.556 --> 00:11:41.692
with finding and destroying
these radioactive monsters.

00:11:41.694 --> 00:11:43.927
But you either can't
or won't tell us

00:11:43.929 --> 00:11:47.497
how many there are
or why they're showing up.

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:50.467
So, maybe it's time for
the military to put them down.

00:11:50.469 --> 00:11:52.534
Killing them
would be a mistake.

00:11:52.536 --> 00:11:54.704
They returned because of us.

00:11:54.706 --> 00:11:59.009
It was our atomic testing
that awoke <i>Gojira.</i>

00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:01.178
Other creatures like the MUTOs

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.246
from strip mining
and seismic surveys.

00:12:04.248 --> 00:12:06.616
But these are not monsters.

00:12:06.618 --> 00:12:08.619
They are animals
rising to reclaim

00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:10.285
a world that was once theirs.

00:12:10.287 --> 00:12:11.654
It almost sounds like

00:12:11.656 --> 00:12:13.756
you're protecting them,
Doctor Serizawa.

00:12:13.758 --> 00:12:15.257
As if you admire them.

00:12:15.259 --> 00:12:18.361
I admire all forms of life.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:21.497
Senators,
if we hope to survive,

00:12:21.499 --> 00:12:25.201
we must find ways
to coexist with Titans.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:27.470
With <i>Gojira.</i>

00:12:27.472 --> 00:12:29.838
A sort of
symbiotic relationship,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.941
if you will.

00:12:31.943 --> 00:12:33.577
Like the lion and the mouse.

00:12:33.579 --> 00:12:36.178
Or the scorpion and the frog.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.914
So you'd want to
make Godzilla our pet?

00:12:38.916 --> 00:12:40.382
No.

00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:42.150
We will be his.

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:49.525
Uh... No. No, actually.

00:12:49.527 --> 00:12:51.059
That's not what
Doctor Serizawa meant.

00:12:51.061 --> 00:12:52.294
We have to go.

00:12:52.296 --> 00:12:53.829
No one is implying
that we would be

00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:55.465
- Godzilla's or anyone's pet.
- Sam, we have to go.

00:12:55.467 --> 00:12:57.034
Doctor Serizawa,
Doctor Graham,

00:12:57.036 --> 00:12:58.367
this hearing is not adjourned.

00:12:58.369 --> 00:13:00.703
Doctor Serizawa,
I hope you understand

00:13:00.705 --> 00:13:04.406
the consequences
of walking out that door.

00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:05.708
Uh, you know what, Senators,

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.209
while I confer
with my colleagues here,

00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:08.611
I'm gonna set you up
with a very brief

00:13:08.613 --> 00:13:10.212
and pretty fun documentary

00:13:10.214 --> 00:13:11.948
on Titan reproduction.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.750
I think this is the one where
the genitals are blurred out.

00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:17.386
But if not, you can leave
a comment with my assistant.

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:21.049
The feed cuts out there.

00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:23.352
The survivors
haven't been able to give us

00:14:23.354 --> 00:14:25.688
much more
than what the footage allows.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:29.428
Only that Emma and Madison
were the only ones taken.

00:14:30.228 --> 00:14:31.794
I'm sorry, Mark.

00:14:31.796 --> 00:14:34.333
I should've been there
for her.

00:14:36.134 --> 00:14:37.299
Who are they?

00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:38.570
We don't know yet.

00:14:40.406 --> 00:14:42.907
We believe
they were after this.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.043
You didn't.

00:14:47.045 --> 00:14:48.510
It's the ORCA.

00:14:48.512 --> 00:14:50.112
Uh, that's why we think
they need Emma.

00:14:50.114 --> 00:14:52.649
She believed that
if we could somehow replicate

00:14:52.651 --> 00:14:54.683
the biosonar the Titans
use to communicate...

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:56.854
I know what the hell it is.
I helped build the prototype.

00:14:58.123 --> 00:14:59.555
Who is he?

00:14:59.557 --> 00:15:01.890
Uh, Sam Coleman.
I'm the head of technology.

00:15:01.892 --> 00:15:04.561
I joined Monarch,
uh, shortly after you left.

00:15:04.563 --> 00:15:05.996
I'm a big fan of your wife...

00:15:05.998 --> 00:15:07.364
...'s work. And you.

00:15:07.366 --> 00:15:09.031
That just came out so weird,
I'm sorry.

00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:10.899
Emma and I destroyed
the prototype.

00:15:10.901 --> 00:15:13.837
And then Emma decided
to rebuild it.

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:16.271
After San Francisco,
she went home to Boston,

00:15:16.273 --> 00:15:17.740
spent years developing it.

00:15:17.742 --> 00:15:19.141
She thought it could help...

00:15:19.143 --> 00:15:20.543
Would help what? Play God?

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:22.578
No.
Help prevent another attack.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.145
ORCA was a grad school
science project.

00:15:24.147 --> 00:15:26.249
It was meant to keep whales
away from the shoreline.

00:15:26.251 --> 00:15:28.483
Not so you could talk to your
little creatures out there.

00:15:28.485 --> 00:15:31.654
Listen to me, they'll think
it's one of them.

00:15:31.656 --> 00:15:34.624
You use the wrong frequency
on one of 'em

00:15:34.626 --> 00:15:36.458
and you're
gonna be responsible

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.428
for 1,000 San Franciscos.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.864
Which is why we need
to get it back.

00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:44.433
Emma always said no one knew
the ORCA better than you.

00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:46.635
It shouldn't even exist.

00:15:46.637 --> 00:15:48.004
That may be, Mark.

00:15:48.006 --> 00:15:49.938
But it's fallen
into the wrong hands.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.476
And right now,
the ORCA is the only thing

00:15:52.478 --> 00:15:55.212
keeping
Emma and Madison alive.

00:15:55.214 --> 00:15:57.213
Mark, we know you're hurting.

00:15:57.215 --> 00:16:00.752
But if we find the ORCA,
we'll find your family.

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.755
I promise.

00:16:12.998 --> 00:16:14.297
<i>When was the last time</i>

00:16:14.299 --> 00:16:15.501
<i>you spoke to Emma?</i>

00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:18.070
About three years ago.

00:16:19.137 --> 00:16:20.602
After San Francisco,

00:16:20.604 --> 00:16:22.608
we went back home to Boston.

00:16:24.709 --> 00:16:27.242
Tried to put
the pieces back together.

00:16:27.244 --> 00:16:31.481
Emma dealt with it by doubling
down on saving the world

00:16:31.483 --> 00:16:33.385
and I started drinking.

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:37.587
I can't tell you
how much I hated myself

00:16:37.589 --> 00:16:39.958
for letting Maddie see me
that way.

00:16:42.393 --> 00:16:43.860
Uh, you mind
if we cut in here?

00:16:43.862 --> 00:16:47.065
It's just,
you're gonna wanna see this.

00:16:48.499 --> 00:16:50.632
Emma combined the bioacoustics

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:53.870
of different Titans
to create the ORCA's signal.

00:16:53.872 --> 00:16:55.704
A sort of baseline frequency

00:16:55.706 --> 00:16:57.774
that all the creatures
respond to.

00:16:57.776 --> 00:16:59.742
Attracting them,
repelling them,

00:16:59.744 --> 00:17:02.711
even at times
calming them down.

00:17:02.713 --> 00:17:04.714
It's pretty remarkable
actually.

00:17:04.716 --> 00:17:05.814
The problem is
we don't know

00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:07.249
which Titans she combined.

00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:09.785
But if you can identify
those frequencies,

00:17:09.787 --> 00:17:12.255
we'll be able
to track the ORCA

00:17:12.257 --> 00:17:14.524
and find Emma and Madison.

00:17:14.526 --> 00:17:16.592
Jesus!

00:17:16.594 --> 00:17:18.527
How many of these things
are there?

00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:21.864
Seventeen and counting
after <i>Gojira.</i>

00:17:21.866 --> 00:17:23.198
Seventeen?

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.800
Most of them were discovered
in deep hibernation.

00:17:24.802 --> 00:17:27.070
While others we've contained

00:17:27.072 --> 00:17:28.671
at top secret sites
around the globe.

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.640
Cambodia, Mexico,
Skull Island.

00:17:31.642 --> 00:17:34.076
We even found one in Wyoming.

00:17:34.078 --> 00:17:35.344
They're everywhere.

00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:36.579
Why don't you kill 'em?

00:17:36.581 --> 00:17:38.313
The government wants to.

00:17:38.315 --> 00:17:42.887
But Emma and I believe
some are benevolent.

00:17:45.323 --> 00:17:46.859
Don't kid yourself.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.896
Uh... Hey, look at that.
We're here.

00:18:02.473 --> 00:18:04.005
<i>Castle Bravo,</i>

00:18:04.007 --> 00:18:05.943
<i>this is Raptor One.
On direct approach.</i>

00:18:11.748 --> 00:18:13.649
<i>Raptor One,
you are cleared</i>

00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:15.953
<i>for assisted descent
to pad four.</i>

00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:26.763
<i>Sensors set
for three meters.</i>

00:18:26.765 --> 00:18:28.167
<i>Beginning sub-surface descent.</i>

00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:33.602
This is new.

00:18:33.604 --> 00:18:35.604
Yeah, we call it Castle Bravo.

00:18:35.606 --> 00:18:37.439
Our new flagship facility

00:18:37.441 --> 00:18:40.810
built to track and study
Godzilla on his own turf.

00:18:40.812 --> 00:18:42.644
I thought he was missing.

00:18:42.646 --> 00:18:45.183
Well, only if you don't know
where to look.

00:18:55.226 --> 00:18:58.561
As you know,
at approximately 0700 hours,

00:18:58.563 --> 00:19:00.697
our containment site

00:19:00.699 --> 00:19:02.698
in China's Yunnan Rainforest
was raided.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.136
The specimen,
code name Mothra, escaped.

00:19:06.138 --> 00:19:10.505
Only to cocoon itself later
under a nearby waterfall.

00:19:10.507 --> 00:19:11.908
While Doctor Emma Russell

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.076
and her daughter Madison
were taken hostage.

00:19:14.078 --> 00:19:18.113
This is the man responsible,
Alan Jonah.

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:21.251
A former British army colonel
turned ecoterrorist.

00:19:21.253 --> 00:19:24.419
Obsessed with restoring
natural order.

00:19:24.421 --> 00:19:25.988
And to fund his operations,

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.225
he began trafficking
in a new and dangerous market.

00:19:29.227 --> 00:19:30.993
Titan DNA.

00:19:30.995 --> 00:19:32.961
What the hell is someone gonna
do with a giant worm?

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:34.563
Are you kidding,
Martinez?

00:19:34.565 --> 00:19:36.032
What can't you do with it?

00:19:36.034 --> 00:19:38.101
Pharmaceuticals,
bioweapons, food...

00:19:38.103 --> 00:19:41.204
Hell, there isn't a country
or a company on the planet

00:19:41.206 --> 00:19:43.104
that doesn't wanna get its
hands on one of these suckers.

00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:46.342
And remember,
this is just a larva.

00:19:46.344 --> 00:19:47.576
That's a baby.

00:19:47.578 --> 00:19:49.611
After it cocoons,

00:19:49.613 --> 00:19:51.013
something else
is gonna crawl out.

00:19:51.015 --> 00:19:53.783
Something bigger, meaner...

00:19:53.785 --> 00:19:55.485
- We don't know that, Rick.
- Oh, yeah?

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.521
Just wait for it, Chen.

00:19:57.523 --> 00:19:59.956
Our intel indicates
that Jonah wants

00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:01.390
to capture this specimen.

00:20:01.392 --> 00:20:02.958
Alive.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.128
Which means that he and his
mercs won't be far behind.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.496
At 0500, we'll ship out
to launch a joint operation...

00:20:08.498 --> 00:20:10.033
I wouldn't bother.

00:20:10.035 --> 00:20:11.167
Excuse me?

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:12.869
Sounds like
a duck hunt to me.

00:20:12.871 --> 00:20:14.402
Uh, Mark, why don't we let
Colonel Foster finish...

00:20:14.404 --> 00:20:16.939
A decoy. A diversion.

00:20:16.941 --> 00:20:18.707
Look, they've already got Emma
and the ORCA.

00:20:18.709 --> 00:20:21.076
Why would they want just this
one when they've got the keys

00:20:21.078 --> 00:20:24.613
to your entire magic kingdom
of horrors back here?

00:20:24.615 --> 00:20:27.283
I think that they want you
to go after this Mothra

00:20:27.285 --> 00:20:29.518
so they can go
after a real prize.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.353
Something bigger.

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:33.054
Right.

00:20:33.056 --> 00:20:34.191
Mark,

00:20:35.324 --> 00:20:36.692
this is not the first specimen
they've captured.

00:20:36.694 --> 00:20:37.927
They know what they are doing.

00:20:37.929 --> 00:20:39.361
That's not
just a specimen.

00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:40.996
I've got an ex-wife
and a daughter out there,

00:20:40.998 --> 00:20:42.331
in case you forgot.

00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:44.734
No. No one has
forgotten that, Mark,

00:20:44.736 --> 00:20:45.935
but, uh, to remind you,

00:20:45.937 --> 00:20:47.369
you were brought on here

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:49.004
to help track the ORCA,
and to advise us...

00:20:49.006 --> 00:20:52.408
I advise you to kill
these things. All of 'em.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.044
Especially him.

00:20:54.046 --> 00:20:55.312
You wanna make sure
these things

00:20:55.314 --> 00:20:56.880
don't fall
into the wrong hands?

00:20:56.882 --> 00:20:58.714
You kill them
and the ORCA's useless.

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:01.383
Emma wouldn't have
wanted that.

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.819
Even to save her life.

00:21:02.821 --> 00:21:04.152
Well, it wouldn't be
the first time

00:21:04.154 --> 00:21:06.288
Emma put all of this
before herself

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:08.359
or her family, would it?

00:21:13.331 --> 00:21:15.364
Dude hates Titans.

00:21:15.366 --> 00:21:17.702
Yeah, well, you would too,
if you were him.

00:21:23.107 --> 00:21:25.207
<i>Outpost 32,
this is Raptor Five,</i>

00:21:25.209 --> 00:21:27.142
<i>on approach with
reinforcements and supplies.</i>

00:21:27.144 --> 00:21:28.812
<i>Requesting permission to land.</i>

00:21:28.814 --> 00:21:31.246
<i>Serizawa has all sites
on high alert,</i>

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:33.649
<i>so transmitting
emergency codes now.</i>

00:21:33.651 --> 00:21:35.950
<i>Copy that, Raptor Five.</i>

00:21:35.952 --> 00:21:38.123
<i>Codes are good.
Nice to have you back.</i>

00:21:45.229 --> 00:21:46.230
Go.

00:21:52.836 --> 00:21:54.204
It's good to see ya.

00:21:54.206 --> 00:21:56.141
- Need a hand with offload?
- No, we're good!

00:21:59.911 --> 00:22:01.509
We're gonna put it
over at bay five.

00:22:01.511 --> 00:22:04.080
- Follow me!
- Go back up! Hey, hey!

00:22:04.082 --> 00:22:06.251
Leave them, let's go!

00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:15.490
I'm scared.

00:22:15.492 --> 00:22:17.228
I know. Me, too.

00:22:21.665 --> 00:22:23.599
Okay.

00:22:23.601 --> 00:22:26.002
Let's go.

00:22:35.513 --> 00:22:36.948
Eyes straight ahead.

00:22:38.382 --> 00:22:39.815
Deep breaths.

00:22:39.817 --> 00:22:41.353
Just like we talked about.

00:23:08.212 --> 00:23:09.714
Hmm.

00:23:21.692 --> 00:23:24.026
Mother of God.

00:23:24.028 --> 00:23:26.731
She had nothing to do
with this.

00:23:35.306 --> 00:23:37.041
Monster Zero.

00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:01.531
Any survivors?

00:24:01.533 --> 00:24:03.998
No. They tried to
launch an emergency beacon,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.501
but we cut them off in time.

00:24:05.503 --> 00:24:07.102
They'll figure it out.

00:24:07.104 --> 00:24:09.037
Fire up the drills.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.076
Do you have
everything you need?

00:24:13.276 --> 00:24:14.643
Good.

00:24:14.645 --> 00:24:16.313
Well, let's get started.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.249
Further.

00:24:42.239 --> 00:24:46.108
<i>We have a grizzly situation
up here in the attic.</i>

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.509
<i>Come on, Andrew.
Andrew.</i>

00:24:47.511 --> 00:24:49.111
<i>I've come to eat
your horses.</i>

00:24:49.113 --> 00:24:50.611
<i>No, you can't eat
my horses...</i>

00:24:50.613 --> 00:24:51.917
<i>That's not...</i>

00:24:52.482 --> 00:24:53.515
<i>Stop.</i>

00:24:53.517 --> 00:24:54.717
<i>Look.</i>

00:24:54.719 --> 00:24:56.752
- <i>An intruder! Get her!</i>
- <i>Get her!</i>

00:24:56.754 --> 00:24:59.088
- <i>Get her! Get her!</i>
- <i>No, don't get me!</i>

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.223
<i>Andrew, Madison!
Get her!</i>

00:25:01.225 --> 00:25:03.159
- <i>Get her!</i>
- <i>Bear kisses.</i>

00:25:05.696 --> 00:25:07.429
<i>Bear kisses!</i>

00:25:15.105 --> 00:25:19.774
<i>All personnel, report
to battle stations. Code red.</i>

00:25:19.776 --> 00:25:22.477
<i>All personnel,
report to battle stations.</i>

00:25:22.479 --> 00:25:24.613
- <i>Code red.</i>
- At least 60 knots.

00:25:24.615 --> 00:25:26.148
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.082
<i>All personnel,
report to battle stations.</i>

00:25:28.084 --> 00:25:29.921
<i>Code red.</i>

00:25:32.524 --> 00:25:33.755
What's happening?

00:25:33.757 --> 00:25:35.056
Something's wrong.

00:25:35.058 --> 00:25:36.958
He's never been
this close before.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.928
- Who's he?
- Who do you think?

00:25:40.698 --> 00:25:43.399
He's taking out
our observation drones.

00:25:43.401 --> 00:25:44.566
Trajectory?

00:25:44.568 --> 00:25:47.703
Straight at us!
1,200 meters and closing.

00:25:47.705 --> 00:25:50.038
G-Team. Barnes,
Martinez, Hendricks,

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.440
I want you on those CROWS now!

00:25:51.442 --> 00:25:53.644
You heard boss lady!
Let's move!

00:26:03.587 --> 00:26:06.088
Doctor Stanton.
Do you have his bioacoustics?

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:07.790
Acoustics coming up!

00:26:09.192 --> 00:26:11.393
Okay, he's closing.
We're at 800 meters!

00:26:11.395 --> 00:26:13.028
Its movements are erratic.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.596
Heart and breathing elevated.

00:26:14.598 --> 00:26:17.065
Yeah, he's definitely
not happy about something.

00:26:17.067 --> 00:26:18.566
How are they getting all this?

00:26:18.568 --> 00:26:21.171
Emma isolated
Godzilla's bioacoustics.

00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:24.006
It allows us to track him.

00:26:24.008 --> 00:26:25.640
Even to get his vitals.

00:26:29.413 --> 00:26:31.813
Circling now,
closing in, 200 meters.

00:26:31.815 --> 00:26:33.248
Colonel!

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.016
All teams in position,
weapons hot,

00:26:35.018 --> 00:26:36.453
ready to engage on my command.

00:26:38.722 --> 00:26:40.124
Come on, come on, come on.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.123
Hold your fire.

00:26:42.125 --> 00:26:43.726
We don't know he'll attack.

00:26:43.728 --> 00:26:46.329
He will if you keep
those guns on him.

00:26:46.331 --> 00:26:48.063
Now I want him dead
more than anybody,

00:26:48.065 --> 00:26:50.364
but unless this is a fight
that you know that you can win,

00:26:50.366 --> 00:26:51.603
for God's sake, stand down.

00:26:58.976 --> 00:27:00.409
Stand down.

00:27:00.411 --> 00:27:01.909
You can't be serious.

00:27:01.911 --> 00:27:03.280
I am.

00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:05.717
Stand down.

00:27:07.818 --> 00:27:09.083
Stand down.

00:27:09.085 --> 00:27:10.285
I say again,
safe your weapons.

00:27:10.287 --> 00:27:11.588
Do not engage.

00:27:16.161 --> 00:27:17.362
Listen.

00:27:19.096 --> 00:27:22.032
His heart rate, it's slowing.

00:27:29.007 --> 00:27:31.640
Open the shields.

00:27:31.642 --> 00:27:33.575
Oh, yeah, sure.
Let's bring him in for a beer.

00:27:33.577 --> 00:27:36.211
You out of your goddamn mind?

00:27:36.213 --> 00:27:38.082
Let him know
we're not a threat.

00:27:39.249 --> 00:27:40.986
Open the shields.

00:27:46.556 --> 00:27:47.558
Do it.

00:28:22.125 --> 00:28:24.427
Hey, what's with
the light show?

00:28:24.429 --> 00:28:27.496
It's an intimidation display.

00:28:27.498 --> 00:28:30.131
Like a gorilla
pounding his chest.

00:28:30.133 --> 00:28:32.167
Consider us very

00:28:32.169 --> 00:28:33.705
intimidated.

00:28:35.373 --> 00:28:37.575
I don't think it's for us.

00:28:46.217 --> 00:28:47.752
What are you doing, dude?

00:29:15.779 --> 00:29:17.281
Well,
that was interesting.

00:29:18.548 --> 00:29:19.550
Jesus!

00:29:29.326 --> 00:29:31.496
Can we maybe
close the shield now?

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.229
Show me
his territorial routes.

00:29:35.231 --> 00:29:36.765
What? Why?

00:29:36.767 --> 00:29:38.667
Because I wanna start
a boat tour. Just show me.

00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:40.835
Okay. Coming up.

00:29:40.837 --> 00:29:42.871
You care to tell us
what you're looking for?

00:29:42.873 --> 00:29:44.806
When an animal leaves
its hunting ground,

00:29:44.808 --> 00:29:46.842
it's usually because
it's threatened by something.

00:29:46.844 --> 00:29:48.311
Run a course projection.

00:29:48.313 --> 00:29:49.811
We gotta go after him.

00:29:49.813 --> 00:29:51.882
He's looking for something
out there.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.285
It could be the ORCA.

00:29:56.853 --> 00:29:59.588
Doctor Stanton,
what's your projection?

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.660
All paths have him
landing in the same place.

00:30:04.394 --> 00:30:05.660
Antarctica.

00:30:05.662 --> 00:30:07.028
Good, then.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.767
I mean, let's go!
Let's go find him. Let's...

00:30:11.101 --> 00:30:14.069
Wait, what's in Antarctica?

00:30:14.071 --> 00:30:15.169
Barnes,

00:30:15.171 --> 00:30:17.371
contact the <i>Argo.</i>

00:30:17.373 --> 00:30:18.610
Yes, ma'am.

00:30:29.853 --> 00:30:31.920
<i>The specimen at this site</i>

00:30:31.922 --> 00:30:33.822
has been kept
entirely off-book.

00:30:33.824 --> 00:30:36.124
And since it's
a more recent discovery,

00:30:36.126 --> 00:30:38.393
our data is limited.

00:30:38.395 --> 00:30:41.129
But it seems to be
another apex predator.

00:30:41.131 --> 00:30:43.698
Emma called it Monster Zero.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.067
It may have been
a rival alpha to Godzilla.

00:30:46.069 --> 00:30:48.903
Battling for dominance
over the other Titans.

00:30:48.905 --> 00:30:50.372
Doctor Chen?

00:30:50.374 --> 00:30:52.940
I've been scouring through
thousands of years

00:30:52.942 --> 00:30:54.476
of myths and legends.

00:30:54.478 --> 00:30:57.079
But it's almost as if
people were scared

00:30:57.081 --> 00:30:58.647
to even write about it.

00:30:58.649 --> 00:31:01.248
As if it was meant
to be forgotten.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.450
Sorry, I hate to crash
a party,

00:31:02.452 --> 00:31:03.718
but I got some bad news.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.353
You could just say news.
It's always bad.

00:31:05.355 --> 00:31:06.755
We lost Godzilla.

00:31:06.757 --> 00:31:08.790
He dropped off the scan
near Venezuela.

00:31:08.792 --> 00:31:09.891
Dropped off?

00:31:09.893 --> 00:31:11.226
I'm telling you,
Doctor Brooks was right.

00:31:11.228 --> 00:31:12.527
It's a Hollow Earth.

00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:14.429
That's how he moves around
so fast

00:31:14.431 --> 00:31:17.600
using these underwater tunnels
like wormholes.

00:31:17.602 --> 00:31:19.534
Just zippin' around.

00:31:19.536 --> 00:31:21.136
Everyone look sharp.

00:31:21.138 --> 00:31:22.974
We're approaching the base.

00:31:32.882 --> 00:31:35.784
- They're here.
- Keep 'em busy.

00:31:35.786 --> 00:31:37.852
Launch reaction force.
Move out!

00:31:37.854 --> 00:31:39.891
All right, gents!
Got the green light!

00:32:00.844 --> 00:32:02.111
If Jonah is looking

00:32:02.113 --> 00:32:03.445
to extract genetic samples

00:32:03.447 --> 00:32:06.282
they'll be here
in the bio labs.

00:32:06.284 --> 00:32:07.783
All right, two minutes!

00:32:07.785 --> 00:32:09.786
Check your equipment,
stand by the door.

00:32:28.238 --> 00:32:30.507
Come on, Ash.
Make it snappy.

00:32:32.343 --> 00:32:34.309
- Detonator ready.
- Let's go.

00:32:34.311 --> 00:32:35.643
Come on, Maddie.

00:32:35.645 --> 00:32:36.847
Move! Move!

00:32:54.965 --> 00:32:57.735
Remember, eyes wide.
We got friendlies in here.

00:32:59.937 --> 00:33:01.703
<i>Move to tunnel two.</i>

00:33:01.705 --> 00:33:03.371
<i>Stay on overwatch.</i>

00:33:03.373 --> 00:33:04.741
<i>Roger that, Chief.</i>

00:33:22.794 --> 00:33:24.493
<i>Ambush! Ambush!</i>

00:33:28.731 --> 00:33:30.832
Team under fire! 360 ambush!

00:33:30.834 --> 00:33:32.603
<i>We're taking heavy losses.</i>

00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:34.504
Break right!

00:33:36.774 --> 00:33:38.073
<i>Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!</i>

00:33:38.075 --> 00:33:39.140
<i>We got friendlies!</i>

00:33:39.142 --> 00:33:40.344
<i>No!</i>

00:33:41.178 --> 00:33:42.380
Mark?

00:33:44.213 --> 00:33:46.214
Get down there and help
Barnes. I'm going after him.

00:33:46.216 --> 00:33:47.418
Roger that.

00:34:00.565 --> 00:34:04.501
Hey, guys.
I'm getting an EKG reading.

00:34:09.306 --> 00:34:11.239
Emma?

00:34:11.241 --> 00:34:12.774
Maddie!

00:34:12.776 --> 00:34:14.411
Number one, let's go.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.417
Barnes, this is Foster.

00:34:22.419 --> 00:34:26.391
I've got eyes on the target.
Repeat, eyes on the target.

00:34:31.962 --> 00:34:33.097
Let 'em go!

00:34:35.698 --> 00:34:37.634
- Ash!
- Dad!

00:34:39.536 --> 00:34:42.337
- Mark.
- Emma, Madison, let's go.

00:34:42.339 --> 00:34:43.538
Dad.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.906
Let's go.

00:34:44.908 --> 00:34:46.074
- Emma, Maddie, come on.
- Daddy?

00:34:46.076 --> 00:34:47.710
Madison, walk to me.

00:34:47.712 --> 00:34:50.344
Walk to me now.
Come on, honey.

00:34:50.346 --> 00:34:52.279
Barnes, I've got two hostages,
one target down.

00:34:52.281 --> 00:34:54.415
- Now! Come on, Maddie.
- <i>I do not have a shot.</i>

00:34:54.417 --> 00:34:55.817
<i>Repeat, I do not have a shot.</i>

00:34:55.819 --> 00:34:57.518
Emma, what are you doing?
Let's go. Come on!

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.022
- Dad.
- Maddie.

00:35:00.223 --> 00:35:01.426
Dad.

00:35:04.227 --> 00:35:05.595
Madison.

00:35:31.689 --> 00:35:33.223
What the hell?

00:35:41.598 --> 00:35:42.967
I'm sorry.

00:35:45.502 --> 00:35:47.069
Run.

00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:02.986
Maddie!

00:36:04.422 --> 00:36:05.623
Dad!

00:36:08.024 --> 00:36:09.026
Move, move!

00:36:25.341 --> 00:36:27.644
- Foster!
- Get out of the way!

00:36:28.812 --> 00:36:30.245
- Let's go!
- Hang on! Move!

00:36:30.247 --> 00:36:31.913
Hendricks, on the double!

00:36:31.915 --> 00:36:33.584
- I got you, Colonel!
- Get her legs!

00:36:35.484 --> 00:36:36.786
We gotta go!

00:36:42.326 --> 00:36:43.528
Damn it!

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.301
Martinez, Foster, let's go!

00:36:53.303 --> 00:36:54.638
Move, move! Come on!

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.743
Come on, let's go!
Strap in!

00:37:01.344 --> 00:37:03.645
No checklist this time.
Check clearance right.

00:37:03.647 --> 00:37:05.080
Clear right.

00:37:05.082 --> 00:37:06.781
- What is Dad doing here?
- I don't know, honey.

00:37:06.783 --> 00:37:08.752
Let's go.

00:37:10.988 --> 00:37:12.554
We can't leave him.

00:37:12.556 --> 00:37:13.788
What are you
waiting for?

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:15.293
Wake it up.

00:37:29.672 --> 00:37:31.241
Let's go! Move it!

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.728
You gotta be fucking kidding.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.208
Fall back! Fall back!

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:16.213
Get to the chopper!

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.149
Go, go, go!

00:39:28.658 --> 00:39:30.126
Open fire!

00:39:39.803 --> 00:39:42.870
We'll do an emergency
vertical take-off at max RPM.

00:39:42.872 --> 00:39:44.174
Number two's
still speeding up.

00:39:57.786 --> 00:39:59.388
Oh, shit.

00:40:23.145 --> 00:40:24.913
This is Raptor One to <i>Argo.</i>

00:40:24.915 --> 00:40:26.980
Requesting immediate
urgent extract.

00:40:26.982 --> 00:40:28.850
Again, I say urgent extract.

00:40:28.852 --> 00:40:30.053
Griffin, get us the hell
out of here!

00:40:32.756 --> 00:40:34.355
Madison!

00:40:34.357 --> 00:40:35.489
Madison, no!

00:40:44.902 --> 00:40:46.902
- You need to let go of it!
- No! No! No!

00:40:46.904 --> 00:40:48.804
- Madison!
- Maddie! Let go!

00:40:48.806 --> 00:40:50.307
No!

00:41:21.672 --> 00:41:23.904
<i>Argo,</i> this is
Raptor One. We've been hit.

00:41:23.906 --> 00:41:25.276
All systems are down.

00:41:27.877 --> 00:41:29.212
Look out!

00:42:49.725 --> 00:42:51.361
Everybody, hold on!

00:43:12.047 --> 00:43:13.250
Mark!

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.185
Everybody,
clear out. Let's go!

00:43:19.187 --> 00:43:20.522
Go! Go!

00:43:20.524 --> 00:43:22.226
- Mark!
- I'm stuck.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:41.408
Are you all right?

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:43.446
Got it!
I got it. Go, go!

00:45:34.156 --> 00:45:35.623
Anything on the satellites?

00:45:35.625 --> 00:45:37.525
Subs have Godzilla hauling ass
off Argentina.

00:45:37.527 --> 00:45:40.795
We lost Monster Zero in
a tropical storm over Brazil.

00:45:40.797 --> 00:45:42.964
Scanning the entire
Southern Hemisphere.

00:45:42.966 --> 00:45:44.199
So far, nothing.

00:45:44.201 --> 00:45:45.433
Then scan the Northern.

00:45:45.435 --> 00:45:46.667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:46.669 --> 00:45:48.268
I know what I saw, Sam.

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.504
And I'm telling you,
she pulled that trigger.

00:45:50.506 --> 00:45:52.339
All due respect, Colonel,
you saw wrong.

00:45:52.341 --> 00:45:54.007
Okay? She wouldn't
have done it.

00:45:54.009 --> 00:45:56.411
Christ, she recruited pretty
much everyone in this room.

00:45:56.413 --> 00:45:58.545
Maybe Jonah forced her, right?

00:45:58.547 --> 00:46:00.482
Maybe he used Madison
as leverage.

00:46:00.484 --> 00:46:02.083
No, no. It had to be
someone else.

00:46:02.085 --> 00:46:03.287
Emma.

00:46:05.721 --> 00:46:07.390
It was Emma.

00:46:08.257 --> 00:46:10.824
Foster saw it right.

00:46:10.826 --> 00:46:12.694
It was her.
No one forced her to.

00:46:12.696 --> 00:46:13.864
Are you sure?

00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:17.799
First, she releases Mothra.

00:46:17.801 --> 00:46:19.500
And now Monster Zero.

00:46:19.502 --> 00:46:22.670
Anyone else sensing
a pattern here?

00:46:22.672 --> 00:46:24.371
Yes,
and not a good one.

00:46:24.373 --> 00:46:26.473
It's as if she is trying
to start a mass awakening.

00:46:26.475 --> 00:46:28.810
Well, it's just too bad
that no one tried

00:46:28.812 --> 00:46:30.478
to warn you that
that was gonna happen.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.946
Hang on, guys.

00:46:31.948 --> 00:46:34.149
Why the hell would she
want to release them?

00:46:34.151 --> 00:46:35.783
And why would she
team up with Jonah,

00:46:35.785 --> 00:46:37.786
of all people, to do it?

00:46:37.788 --> 00:46:38.886
We'll ask her

00:46:38.888 --> 00:46:40.790
when we find her.

00:46:41.924 --> 00:46:45.261
So, let's keep looking.

00:46:59.643 --> 00:47:01.475
<i>Godzilla
appears to be following</i>

00:47:01.477 --> 00:47:03.076
the same path
as Emma's osprey,

00:47:03.078 --> 00:47:05.846
heading north
over South America to here.

00:47:05.848 --> 00:47:08.583
Outpost 56 in Isla de Mara,
Mexico.

00:47:08.585 --> 00:47:10.752
We touch down there
in ten minutes.

00:47:10.754 --> 00:47:12.120
What about the people?

00:47:12.122 --> 00:47:13.654
I'm sorry?

00:47:13.656 --> 00:47:16.257
The people. The people
down there in that village

00:47:16.259 --> 00:47:17.893
that don't realize
they're gonna be

00:47:17.895 --> 00:47:19.261
the special of the day.

00:47:19.263 --> 00:47:21.161
We've sent G-Team
to begin an evacuation.

00:47:21.163 --> 00:47:22.462
Doctor Serizawa,

00:47:22.464 --> 00:47:24.031
we have a call
on the emergency channel

00:47:24.033 --> 00:47:25.132
from Isla de Mara.

00:47:25.134 --> 00:47:26.569
Answer it.

00:47:34.743 --> 00:47:36.210
<i>I suppose I should go first.</i>

00:47:36.212 --> 00:47:38.145
Where's Madison?

00:47:38.147 --> 00:47:40.448
- <i>She's right here with me.</i>
- <i>Dad, are you okay?</i>

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:42.783
Madison, you all right, hon?

00:47:42.785 --> 00:47:43.786
<i>Dad...</i>

00:47:45.122 --> 00:47:47.254
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:47:47.256 --> 00:47:48.455
You don't need to be...

00:47:48.457 --> 00:47:49.824
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

00:47:49.826 --> 00:47:51.091
<i>I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

00:47:51.093 --> 00:47:52.692
She's fine, Mark, trust me.

00:47:52.694 --> 00:47:54.194
<i>Trust is a little hard</i>

00:47:54.196 --> 00:47:55.529
<i>to come by, Doctor Russell.</i>

00:47:55.531 --> 00:47:57.130
Especially after
what you pulled.

00:47:57.132 --> 00:47:58.600
<i>I know.</i>

00:47:58.602 --> 00:48:03.103
And I can only imagine
what you're all thinking.

00:48:03.105 --> 00:48:06.908
<i>But if there were any other
way to do this, I would.</i>

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:08.545
Do what, Emma?

00:48:09.411 --> 00:48:11.045
<i>I'm saving the world.</i>

00:48:11.047 --> 00:48:13.714
But by releasing those things?
That doesn't make sense.

00:48:13.716 --> 00:48:17.150
<i>As impossible
as it seems, it does.</i>

00:48:17.152 --> 00:48:19.120
<i>Hear me out, Mark.</i>

00:48:19.122 --> 00:48:20.821
<i>After we lost Andrew,</i>

00:48:20.823 --> 00:48:23.757
<i>I swore his death
would not be in vain.</i>

00:48:23.759 --> 00:48:26.127
<i>That I would find an answer.</i>

00:48:26.129 --> 00:48:28.495
<i>A solution to why
the Titans were rising.</i>

00:48:28.497 --> 00:48:30.029
<i>But as I dug deeper,</i>

00:48:30.031 --> 00:48:34.301
<i>I realized that
they were here for a reason.</i>

00:48:34.303 --> 00:48:35.736
<i>And that despite all the years</i>

00:48:35.738 --> 00:48:39.107
<i>that we spent
trying to stop them,</i>

00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:41.475
<i>we never dared
to confront the truth.</i>

00:48:41.477 --> 00:48:43.310
Which truth?

00:48:43.312 --> 00:48:46.580
Humans have been the dominant
species for thousands of years

00:48:46.582 --> 00:48:48.181
and look what's happened.

00:48:48.183 --> 00:48:50.451
Overpopulation,

00:48:50.453 --> 00:48:53.687
<i>pollution, war.</i>

00:48:53.689 --> 00:48:58.192
<i>The mass extinction we feared
has already begun.</i>

00:48:58.194 --> 00:49:01.328
<i>And we are the cause.</i>

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:04.031
<i>We are the infection.</i>

00:49:04.033 --> 00:49:06.100
<i>But like all living organisms,</i>

00:49:06.102 --> 00:49:09.504
<i>the earth unleashed a fever
to fight this infection.</i>

00:49:09.506 --> 00:49:13.540
<i>Its original
and rightful rulers,</i>

00:49:13.542 --> 00:49:15.208
<i>the Titans.</i>

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:18.379
<i>They are part of the earth's
natural defense system.</i>

00:49:18.381 --> 00:49:22.650
<i>A way to protect the planet,
to maintain its balance.</i>

00:49:22.652 --> 00:49:26.788
<i>But if governments are allowed
to contain them, destroy them,</i>

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:28.788
<i>or use them for war,</i>

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:31.926
<i>the human infection will only
continue to spread.</i>

00:49:31.928 --> 00:49:37.998
<i>And within our lifetime,
our planet will perish,</i>

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.699
<i>and so will we.</i>

00:49:39.701 --> 00:49:42.703
Unless we restore balance.

00:49:42.705 --> 00:49:45.239
<i>And what's gonna
be left, if you do this?</i>

00:49:45.241 --> 00:49:48.976
<i>A dead, charred world,
overrun by monsters?</i>

00:49:48.978 --> 00:49:50.344
No, Doctor Stanton,

00:49:50.346 --> 00:49:52.013
<i>the exact opposite.</i>

00:49:52.015 --> 00:49:54.915
<i>Just like how a forest fire
replenishes the soil</i>

00:49:54.917 --> 00:49:57.518
<i>or how a volcano
creates new land,</i>

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.254
<i>we have seen signs that these
creatures will do the same.</i>

00:50:00.256 --> 00:50:04.091
<i>San Francisco, Las Vegas,
wherever the Titans go,</i>

00:50:04.093 --> 00:50:07.795
<i>life follows,
triggered by their radiation.</i>

00:50:07.797 --> 00:50:09.964
<i>They are the only thing
that can reverse</i>

00:50:09.966 --> 00:50:11.833
<i>the destruction
that we started.</i>

00:50:11.835 --> 00:50:15.969
<i>They are the only guarantee
that life will carry on.</i>

00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:19.205
<i>But for that to happen,
we must set them free.</i>

00:50:19.207 --> 00:50:20.975
You are murdering the world.

00:50:20.977 --> 00:50:22.210
<i>No.</i>

00:50:22.212 --> 00:50:24.310
<i>Because as difficult
as this will be,</i>

00:50:24.312 --> 00:50:27.214
<i>I promise
humanity will not go extinct.</i>

00:50:27.216 --> 00:50:31.819
<i>Using the ORCA, we will return
to a natural order.</i>

00:50:31.821 --> 00:50:34.355
<i>A forgotten order,
where we coexisted</i>

00:50:34.357 --> 00:50:36.123
<i>in balance with the Titans.</i>

00:50:36.125 --> 00:50:38.058
<i>The first gods.</i>

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.694
This is a dangerous path.

00:50:40.696 --> 00:50:43.931
You are meddling with forces
beyond our comprehension.

00:50:43.933 --> 00:50:45.966
Gambling with
the lives of billions!

00:50:45.968 --> 00:50:48.301
<i>And what are you gambling
with, Serizawa?</i>

00:50:48.303 --> 00:50:50.004
<i>Monarch is broken.</i>

00:50:50.006 --> 00:50:51.973
<i>It's on the verge of being
shut down by a government</i>

00:50:51.975 --> 00:50:54.408
<i>whose only objective is to
eradicate the creatures.</i>

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:57.444
<i>And if that happens,
what will our chances be?</i>

00:50:57.446 --> 00:50:59.212
You are out
of your goddamn mind!

00:50:59.214 --> 00:51:01.082
<i>First, you put
our daughter's life in danger,</i>

00:51:01.084 --> 00:51:02.815
<i>and now you get to
decide the fate of the world.</i>

00:51:02.817 --> 00:51:05.319
- That's rich, Emma!
- I couldn't be more sane,

00:51:05.321 --> 00:51:07.522
<i>and Madison
couldn't be stronger.</i>

00:51:07.524 --> 00:51:10.491
<i>After we lost Andrew,
I trained her to survive.</i>

00:51:10.493 --> 00:51:13.728
<i>And at least now, she will
have a fighting chance.</i>

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.897
A fighting chance? Why don't
you listen to yourself?

00:51:15.899 --> 00:51:18.065
<i>It's not all math, Emma.</i>

00:51:18.067 --> 00:51:19.900
<i>Some things,
you can't control.</i>

00:51:19.902 --> 00:51:22.538
<i>And there are some things
that you can't run from.</i>

00:51:23.973 --> 00:51:26.410
This won't bring him
back to us.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.660
<i>I can only urge you all
to take refuge.</i>

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.259
<i>Over the last 60 years,</i>

00:51:46.261 --> 00:51:48.929
<i>Monarch has prepared bunkers
around the world</i>

00:51:48.931 --> 00:51:51.565
<i>to save
and restart civilization.</i>

00:51:51.567 --> 00:51:53.536
<i>I suggest you find them.</i>

00:52:00.743 --> 00:52:02.076
That bitch.

00:52:02.078 --> 00:52:04.578
How long
until this thing lands?

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:05.913
Three minutes.

00:52:05.915 --> 00:52:07.482
You might
want to rethink that.

00:52:07.484 --> 00:52:08.850
Why?

00:52:08.852 --> 00:52:10.750
Something's not right.
Check this out.

00:52:10.752 --> 00:52:13.053
Emma's not at Isla de Mara.

00:52:13.055 --> 00:52:15.723
I mean, the signal's too weak
to be local.

00:52:15.725 --> 00:52:17.491
She's bouncing it off
our satellites.

00:52:17.493 --> 00:52:19.893
They must be holed up
in one of our old bunkers.

00:52:19.895 --> 00:52:21.694
She could be anywhere.

00:52:21.696 --> 00:52:25.232
What is that?

00:52:25.234 --> 00:52:29.270
Oh, Jesus! She shut down
the containment system.

00:52:29.272 --> 00:52:30.607
How much time do we have?

00:52:31.906 --> 00:52:33.373
Containment system bypassed.
We're patched in.

00:52:33.375 --> 00:52:35.178
- Hmm.
- Ready to broadcast the ORCA.

00:52:37.413 --> 00:52:38.848
Doctor?

00:52:52.395 --> 00:52:53.995
Mom, don't!

00:52:53.997 --> 00:52:57.096
I'm sorry, did a child
just tell you what to do?

00:52:57.098 --> 00:52:58.833
Maybe Dad is right.
Maybe this isn't the way.

00:52:58.835 --> 00:53:00.533
By all means, Doctor Russell,

00:53:00.535 --> 00:53:02.101
let's reconsider
our entire plan.

00:53:02.103 --> 00:53:03.804
Especially after telling
your friends about it.

00:53:03.806 --> 00:53:05.640
Madison, we talked about this.

00:53:05.642 --> 00:53:07.107
No, you said you were
gonna help people,

00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:08.542
that you would let them
find shelter.

00:53:08.544 --> 00:53:11.879
We don't have time for this!

00:53:11.881 --> 00:53:13.815
Did you really think
this was gonna be easy?

00:53:13.817 --> 00:53:15.415
Painless?
Is that what you told her?

00:53:15.417 --> 00:53:16.917
Leave her out of this.

00:53:16.919 --> 00:53:18.585
Why? You're the one
who pulled her into it.

00:53:18.587 --> 00:53:22.623
Madison, tell me, what exactly
did Mommy sell you on?

00:53:22.625 --> 00:53:24.125
Some grand utopia?

00:53:24.127 --> 00:53:25.993
Man and monster,
living together

00:53:25.995 --> 00:53:27.527
in blissful harmony?

00:53:27.529 --> 00:53:29.830
Sir, they're
attempting to lock us out.

00:53:29.832 --> 00:53:31.232
It's now or never.

00:53:31.234 --> 00:53:35.904
Emma, you came to me.
This is your plan.

00:53:35.906 --> 00:53:37.839
We both want
to save the planet,

00:53:37.841 --> 00:53:39.073
but everything is going to die

00:53:39.075 --> 00:53:41.107
if we don't see it through.

00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:45.015
Please, at least let them
get to safety.

00:53:46.716 --> 00:53:49.886
Ma'am, our window's closing.

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.023
Mom...

00:53:55.924 --> 00:53:57.690
I'm sorry, Madison.

00:53:57.692 --> 00:53:59.696
This is bigger
than just you and me.

00:54:25.221 --> 00:54:26.821
Tell them
to slow it down!

00:54:26.823 --> 00:54:28.325
Tell them to stand back!

00:54:36.364 --> 00:54:38.734
Move! Get out of the way!

00:55:03.058 --> 00:55:04.259
Clear, men!

00:55:42.864 --> 00:55:44.964
You got a catchy name
for this one?

00:55:44.966 --> 00:55:46.667
Local legends call it

00:55:46.669 --> 00:55:49.370
Rodan, the fire demon.

00:55:49.372 --> 00:55:51.605
That's comforting.

00:55:51.607 --> 00:55:52.973
Guys?

00:55:52.975 --> 00:55:54.741
You remember
that tropical storm

00:55:54.743 --> 00:55:56.009
where we lost Monster Zero?

00:55:56.011 --> 00:55:58.846
It's changing direction
and, uh,

00:55:58.848 --> 00:56:00.348
guess where it's headed now.

00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:02.382
That's not possible.

00:56:02.384 --> 00:56:04.217
No storm moves that fast.

00:56:04.219 --> 00:56:06.922
Unless
it's not a storm.

00:56:09.024 --> 00:56:10.623
- Oh, man!
- We need time

00:56:10.625 --> 00:56:11.893
to finish the evacuation.

00:56:11.895 --> 00:56:13.060
Well,
then you'd better hurry,

00:56:13.062 --> 00:56:14.261
'cause it's closing in fast.

00:56:14.263 --> 00:56:16.462
Serizawa,
it's not a coincidence

00:56:16.464 --> 00:56:18.466
that Monster Zero thing
is headed here.

00:56:18.468 --> 00:56:20.199
It's reacting
to Big Bird's cries.

00:56:20.201 --> 00:56:22.303
That means it's coming
for food, a fight, or a...

00:56:22.305 --> 00:56:24.705
Something more intimate.

00:56:24.707 --> 00:56:26.710
What do you suggest?

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:29.710
<i>All fighters,</i>

00:56:29.712 --> 00:56:31.448
<i>weapons free.</i>

00:56:54.402 --> 00:56:56.036
Oh, I think
we got his attention.

00:56:56.038 --> 00:56:57.737
Everyone strap in.

00:56:57.739 --> 00:56:59.975
All ships, follow our lead.

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:36.542
No!

00:57:37.779 --> 00:57:39.078
Please! Wait!

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.848
It's gonna be okay!

00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:42.451
Hang on, kid!

00:57:58.835 --> 00:58:00.333
<i>Argo</i> to Gold Squadron.

00:58:00.335 --> 00:58:02.669
Let's lure this turkey
away from the mainland

00:58:02.671 --> 00:58:03.804
straight to Monster Zero.

00:58:03.806 --> 00:58:05.071
ETA two minutes!

00:58:05.073 --> 00:58:06.906
Gold Squadron,
engage on our six.

00:58:06.908 --> 00:58:08.510
<i>Copy. Start the clock.</i>

00:58:26.594 --> 00:58:28.864
<i>Bogey.
Nine o'clock high!</i>

00:58:36.004 --> 00:58:37.770
Duster 223.

00:58:37.772 --> 00:58:39.640
<i>Get out of there. He's on
your tail! Get out of there!</i>

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:49.884
Cobra's Raptor
is off the team!

00:58:49.886 --> 00:58:52.355
ETA to Monster Zero,
60 seconds!

00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:55.823
<i>Raptor 37.</i>

00:58:55.825 --> 00:58:58.060
<i>Bogey coming up on your six.</i>

00:59:09.138 --> 00:59:10.270
<i>I'm losing control here.</i>

00:59:10.272 --> 00:59:11.538
<i>I'm losing control!</i>

00:59:16.978 --> 00:59:18.879
We lost the squadron!

00:59:18.881 --> 00:59:21.116
ETA to Monster Zero,
30 seconds!

00:59:38.767 --> 00:59:39.969
Ten seconds!

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:03.625
Dive! Dive!

01:00:28.017 --> 01:00:29.783
Jesus,
they're killing each other.

01:00:29.785 --> 01:00:31.018
<i>Mayday, mayday!
This is Raptor One to</i> Argo.

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.752
Argo, <i>do you read?</i>

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:34.420
<i>Copy, Raptor
One. What's your status?</i>

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:36.156
<i>We're screwed,
that's what.</i>

01:00:36.158 --> 01:00:37.558
And we got kids on board.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.292
We're gonna need
immediate mid-air retrieval.

01:00:39.294 --> 01:00:40.694
Lock on to their position,
and prepare the hangar

01:00:40.696 --> 01:00:42.328
for an emergency landing.

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:43.562
Hangar doors are unresponsive.

01:00:43.564 --> 01:00:45.968
- Manual override?
- They're stuck!

01:00:47.535 --> 01:00:48.835
All right,
which way to the hangar?

01:00:48.837 --> 01:00:49.969
I can show you.

01:00:49.971 --> 01:00:51.605
Anybody else?

01:00:51.607 --> 01:00:54.174
I know the way.
I... Come on!

01:00:54.176 --> 01:00:55.611
Hope you got a big wrench.

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:06.821
What's the problem?

01:01:06.823 --> 01:01:08.221
Hydraulics systems are jammed!

01:01:08.223 --> 01:01:09.989
I'm trying to
jump-start power.

01:01:09.991 --> 01:01:11.125
It's not looking good.

01:01:19.768 --> 01:01:22.104
It's Admiral Stenz.

01:01:22.937 --> 01:01:24.605
Admiral.

01:01:24.607 --> 01:01:26.440
<i>Doctor
Serizawa, Colonel Foster.</i>

01:01:26.442 --> 01:01:28.208
<i>I need you and your forces
to immediately disengage</i>

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:29.975
<i>and withdraw
to a safe distance.</i>

01:01:29.977 --> 01:01:32.112
Admiral, I don't understand.

01:01:32.114 --> 01:01:35.949
<i>We have been developing
a prototype for a new weapon.</i>

01:01:35.951 --> 01:01:37.650
<i>An oxygen destroyer.</i>

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:40.855
<i>Designed to exterminate
all life forms</i>

01:01:40.857 --> 01:01:42.388
<i>within a two-mile radius.</i>

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:44.357
<i>With any luck,
it will kill these things</i>

01:01:44.359 --> 01:01:46.726
<i>and this nightmare
will finally be over.</i>

01:01:46.728 --> 01:01:48.527
Admiral, we must
keep our faith in <i>Gojira.</i>

01:01:48.529 --> 01:01:51.198
<i>I'm sorry, Doctor.
You had your chance.</i>

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.565
<i>The missile is
already on its way.</i>

01:01:52.567 --> 01:01:54.804
<i>May God have mercy on us all.</i>

01:01:58.339 --> 01:02:00.140
He's not lying.

01:02:00.142 --> 01:02:01.942
It's coming in hot.

01:02:01.944 --> 01:02:04.310
Argo, <i>you gotta get
those bay doors open now!</i>

01:02:04.312 --> 01:02:05.978
Have the crash
and fire crews ready.

01:02:12.488 --> 01:02:14.357
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:20.062
Look out!

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:25.501
Hold on!

01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:29.569
Come on, Griff! Come on!

01:02:29.571 --> 01:02:33.076
Hit it! Hit it!

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:50.623
That's what
I'm talking about, Griff!

01:02:50.625 --> 01:02:52.627
Everybody okay?

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:55.661
Get over
to the back of the hangar.

01:02:55.663 --> 01:02:57.330
We're all gonna head this way.
This way. This way.

01:02:57.332 --> 01:02:59.165
Thanks for the lift!

01:03:01.169 --> 01:03:02.571
Go! Go!

01:03:04.806 --> 01:03:06.408
Oh, God!

01:03:31.334 --> 01:03:32.565
We're getting
out of here.

01:03:32.567 --> 01:03:34.167
The military
launched a weapon.

01:03:34.169 --> 01:03:35.368
It's gonna kill 'em both.

01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:37.270
Well, that's not
the worst idea.

01:03:45.013 --> 01:03:46.580
Ten,

01:03:46.582 --> 01:03:47.817
nine,

01:03:49.017 --> 01:03:50.583
eight,

01:03:50.585 --> 01:03:52.254
seven...

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:06.636
...three, two...

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.846
Jesus.

01:04:52.848 --> 01:04:56.149
Doctor Stanton,
can you locate <i>Gojira?</i>

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.922
Yeah. I got something.

01:05:02.658 --> 01:05:07.763
His vitals are fading.
Radiation levels plummeting.

01:05:09.431 --> 01:05:11.701
Come on, big guy. Fight it.

01:05:21.977 --> 01:05:23.379
He's gone.

01:05:26.747 --> 01:05:29.718
Looks like you got
your wish, Mark.

01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:57.103
I thought we were going
to release them gradually.

01:06:57.105 --> 01:06:59.542
One at a time.

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:02.944
I'm not the one doing this.

01:07:08.616 --> 01:07:10.652
Long live the king.

01:07:22.196 --> 01:07:24.065
You're a monster.

01:07:35.877 --> 01:07:37.611
<i>Castle Bravo, this is</i>

01:07:37.613 --> 01:07:39.612
<i>Containment Team Mosura.
Do you read? Over.</i>

01:07:39.614 --> 01:07:41.147
Castle Bravo,
this is Containment Team.

01:07:41.149 --> 01:07:42.214
Anything?

01:07:42.216 --> 01:07:43.583
Dr. Brooks.

01:07:43.585 --> 01:07:45.152
We've lost contact
with the <i>Argo,</i>

01:07:45.154 --> 01:07:47.154
Castle Bravo and the other
containment sites.

01:07:47.156 --> 01:07:50.457
Angkor Wat, Skull Island,
Stone Mountain.

01:07:50.459 --> 01:07:53.125
All the Titans,
they're escaping.

01:07:53.127 --> 01:07:55.663
<i>Repeat,
this may be our last comm.</i>

01:07:57.299 --> 01:07:59.031
Wait, wait, wait.

01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:00.600
It's... It's him.

01:08:00.602 --> 01:08:02.435
He's the one doing this.

01:08:02.437 --> 01:08:05.973
They're responding
to his call.

01:08:06.908 --> 01:08:09.178
Oh, God!
Where's Doctor Ling?

01:08:10.379 --> 01:08:11.980
She's outside.

01:08:13.381 --> 01:08:17.553
Doctor Ling! We've lost
contact with Monarch.

01:08:19.054 --> 01:08:20.656
Doctor Ling?

01:09:31.225 --> 01:09:33.227
- Madison, wait!
- Get away from me!

01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:34.927
Look, I know things
haven't gone

01:09:34.929 --> 01:09:37.396
exactly according to plan,
but I can fix this.

01:09:37.398 --> 01:09:38.731
According to plan?

01:09:38.733 --> 01:09:40.100
You said that you were
gonna be careful.

01:09:40.102 --> 01:09:41.467
That you'd release them
one at a time,

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:42.701
that you would
restore balance!

01:09:42.703 --> 01:09:44.170
They were gonna
take over Monarch

01:09:44.172 --> 01:09:45.704
and kill the Titans.
I didn't have a choice.

01:09:45.706 --> 01:09:47.542
Bullshit!

01:09:50.845 --> 01:09:54.183
You said we were
doing this for Andrew.

01:09:58.653 --> 01:10:01.991
Do you really think
he would've wanted this?

01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:10.598
Exactly.

01:10:14.937 --> 01:10:16.205
Madison!

01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:20.209
Madison!

01:10:32.955 --> 01:10:34.590
Any luck?

01:10:35.357 --> 01:10:37.257
No.

01:10:37.259 --> 01:10:40.826
Whatever Emma used
to create the ORCA signal,

01:10:40.828 --> 01:10:42.427
I've never heard it.

01:10:42.429 --> 01:10:43.597
How are you doing?

01:10:45.399 --> 01:10:46.700
How's that?

01:10:46.702 --> 01:10:49.235
"Myth is our compass."

01:10:49.237 --> 01:10:51.337
It's something
my mom used to say.

01:10:51.339 --> 01:10:54.039
She believed our stories
about monsters and dragons

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:57.142
could help us find the Titans

01:10:57.144 --> 01:10:59.012
and restore
our connection to nature.

01:10:59.014 --> 01:11:00.512
Wait, your mother?

01:11:00.514 --> 01:11:02.115
You're second-generation
Monarch?

01:11:02.117 --> 01:11:03.749
Third.

01:11:03.751 --> 01:11:06.018
It runs in the family.

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.786
That's incredible.

01:11:07.788 --> 01:11:09.088
I don't suppose
your family has any tips

01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:10.457
on slaying dragons, do they?

01:11:10.459 --> 01:11:13.192
Slaying dragons
is a Western concept.

01:11:13.194 --> 01:11:15.194
In the East, they are sacred.

01:11:15.196 --> 01:11:19.134
Divine creatures who brought
wisdom, strength,

01:11:20.135 --> 01:11:21.737
even redemption.

01:11:24.538 --> 01:11:25.806
This oxygen destroyer,

01:11:25.808 --> 01:11:27.106
why wasn't
Monster Zero affected?

01:11:27.108 --> 01:11:28.408
I mean,
I'm no scientist,

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:29.941
but I think
it has something to do

01:11:29.943 --> 01:11:31.276
with his goddamn head
growing back.

01:11:31.278 --> 01:11:33.045
Well, I've never seen
anything like it.

01:11:33.047 --> 01:11:35.548
It violates everything we know
about the natural order.

01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:38.450
Unless he's not
part of the natural order.

01:11:38.452 --> 01:11:39.753
What do you mean?

01:11:39.755 --> 01:11:43.390
I was able to
piece this together.

01:11:43.392 --> 01:11:46.292
Well, he looks
vaguely familiar.

01:11:46.294 --> 01:11:48.360
It tells
of a great dragon

01:11:48.362 --> 01:11:49.963
who fell from the stars.

01:11:49.965 --> 01:11:54.500
A Hydra whose storm swallowed
both men and gods alike.

01:11:54.502 --> 01:11:56.002
What, you mean an alien?

01:11:56.004 --> 01:11:58.605
Yes. He's not
part of our natural order.

01:11:58.607 --> 01:12:00.472
And he's not meant to be here.

01:12:00.474 --> 01:12:02.075
A false king.

01:12:02.077 --> 01:12:03.776
An invasive species.

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:06.346
That could explain how he's
creating these massive storms

01:12:06.348 --> 01:12:09.048
and the effect he's having
on the other Titans.

01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:10.816
It's almost like
he's reshaping the planet

01:12:10.818 --> 01:12:12.185
to his own liking.

01:12:12.187 --> 01:12:13.820
These legends,
what did they call him?

01:12:13.822 --> 01:12:17.226
Ghidorah.
"The one who is many."

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:18.857
Ghi-what?

01:12:18.859 --> 01:12:20.060
She said, "Gonorrhea."

01:12:20.062 --> 01:12:21.527
- Huh?
- Ghidorah!

01:12:21.529 --> 01:12:24.263
Doctor Serizawa, we're
approaching Castle Bravo,

01:12:24.265 --> 01:12:26.798
but there's something
you should see.

01:12:31.239 --> 01:12:35.008
I'm guessing you weren't
expecting these guys.

01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:39.378
Moscow,
London, Washington, D.C.,

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:41.146
all under attack.

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:43.383
On every continent,
the Titans are triggering

01:12:43.385 --> 01:12:46.352
earthquakes, wildfires,
tsunamis,

01:12:46.354 --> 01:12:49.922
and disasters we don't even
have names for yet.

01:12:49.924 --> 01:12:52.459
Now as before,
we have been trying to lure

01:12:52.461 --> 01:12:54.127
the creatures
with nuclear materials,

01:12:54.129 --> 01:12:56.797
but they are not
taking the bait this time.

01:12:56.799 --> 01:12:59.531
Their behavior
has become random.

01:12:59.533 --> 01:13:01.000
Erratic.

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:03.468
And with our forces
spread desperately thin

01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:06.573
and these things
roaming the globe unimpeded,

01:13:06.575 --> 01:13:08.774
we are running out of options

01:13:08.776 --> 01:13:10.176
and time.

01:13:10.178 --> 01:13:12.712
Excuse me,
do you have something to add?

01:13:12.714 --> 01:13:14.847
Yeah. You're wrong.

01:13:14.849 --> 01:13:18.485
Their behavior
is not random or erratic.

01:13:18.487 --> 01:13:19.585
If I may, sir.

01:13:19.587 --> 01:13:22.088
As amazing as this sounds,

01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:24.323
they're moving like a pack.
They're hunting.

01:13:24.325 --> 01:13:28.061
All packs, from wolves
to killer whales,

01:13:28.063 --> 01:13:30.664
they all respond
directly to an alpha.

01:13:30.666 --> 01:13:32.332
And this Ghidorah
is the new alpha.

01:13:32.334 --> 01:13:34.866
And all the other creatures
are just doing his bidding.

01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:37.303
They're an extension of him.

01:13:37.305 --> 01:13:40.839
We stop him, we stop them all.

01:13:40.841 --> 01:13:42.174
Is there another creature

01:13:42.176 --> 01:13:43.575
that might stand
a chance against him?

01:13:43.577 --> 01:13:45.311
No.

01:13:45.313 --> 01:13:49.149
Ghidorah and <i>Gojira's</i> rivalry
was ancient and unique.

01:13:49.151 --> 01:13:51.116
Right, so we killed
our best shot

01:13:51.118 --> 01:13:52.918
at beating this thing?

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:55.888
<i>Jonah, you don't get it.
This changes everything.</i>

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:57.323
<i>With Godzilla gone,</i>

01:13:57.325 --> 01:13:58.490
<i>Monster Zero
isn't using the Titans</i>

01:13:58.492 --> 01:14:00.292
to restore the planet.

01:14:00.294 --> 01:14:03.029
He is using them
to destroy it.

01:14:03.031 --> 01:14:05.330
This isn't coexistence.
This is extinction.

01:14:05.332 --> 01:14:07.667
Listen, while you were
sitting comfortably

01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:08.935
in some laboratory,

01:14:08.937 --> 01:14:10.936
we've been fighting
for decades

01:14:10.938 --> 01:14:13.440
in one dirty war
after another.

01:14:13.442 --> 01:14:15.475
I've seen
human nature firsthand

01:14:15.477 --> 01:14:16.543
and I'm here to tell you

01:14:16.545 --> 01:14:17.677
that it doesn't
get any better.

01:14:17.679 --> 01:14:19.012
It just gets worse.

01:14:19.014 --> 01:14:21.414
So, I'm sorry
that Monster Zero

01:14:21.416 --> 01:14:24.350
isn't exactly
what we were expecting.

01:14:24.352 --> 01:14:30.058
But we opened Pandora's Box
and there's no closing it now.

01:14:31.992 --> 01:14:33.359
Maybe there is.

01:14:33.361 --> 01:14:35.093
Oh, don't be stupid.

01:14:35.095 --> 01:14:38.297
You broadcast again,
and you will expose us all.

01:14:38.299 --> 01:14:40.665
These creatures
communicate like whales, okay?

01:14:40.667 --> 01:14:43.201
<i>They can hear
sonar for thousands of miles,</i>

01:14:43.203 --> 01:14:45.471
<i>so let's send a team.</i>

01:14:45.473 --> 01:14:47.606
<i>Let's broadcast the ORCA
from Fenway.</i>

01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:49.308
<i>It's just a few miles
from here.</i>

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:52.111
I could use the stadium
to amplify a signal

01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:53.812
that might stop these attacks.

01:14:53.814 --> 01:14:56.682
<i>The city's already being
evacuated, so it'll be safe.</i>

01:14:56.684 --> 01:14:58.284
<i>And then what?</i>

01:14:58.286 --> 01:14:59.852
<i>And then I'll figure out
what the hell</i>

01:14:59.854 --> 01:15:01.922
<i>Monster Zero really is
and try to stop it.</i>

01:15:01.924 --> 01:15:03.222
<i>Before Monarch finds us?</i>

01:15:03.224 --> 01:15:04.723
<i>I'm sure
all your friends will be</i>

01:15:04.725 --> 01:15:06.124
<i>very happy to see you again.</i>

01:15:06.126 --> 01:15:07.927
<i>We can't just sit here.</i>

01:15:07.929 --> 01:15:10.762
<i>All right? This isn't
the world that we wanted.</i>

01:15:10.764 --> 01:15:12.397
<i>I seem to remember
you telling me</i>

01:15:12.399 --> 01:15:15.267
<i>that the world
always belonged to them.</i>

01:15:15.269 --> 01:15:18.574
<i>Well, maybe it is time
we gave it back.</i>

01:15:21.408 --> 01:15:23.310
Mark!

01:15:23.312 --> 01:15:25.712
Mark, wait.
What are you doing?

01:15:25.714 --> 01:15:28.548
I can't just sit down there.
I gotta do something.

01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:29.883
Like what?

01:15:29.885 --> 01:15:31.817
- Like go find my daughter.
- How?

01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:33.221
Where are you gonna go?

01:15:34.989 --> 01:15:37.459
She's the only thing
I got left, Sam.

01:15:39.694 --> 01:15:41.060
I wasn't there for her.

01:15:41.062 --> 01:15:43.497
I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

01:15:45.399 --> 01:15:46.535
Good luck.

01:16:58.572 --> 01:17:00.075
Beautiful.

01:17:01.274 --> 01:17:02.408
Mothra.

01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:06.079
Queen of the Monsters.

01:17:06.081 --> 01:17:08.483
Are you recording this,
Stanton?

01:17:10.285 --> 01:17:13.552
I record everything now.

01:17:13.554 --> 01:17:15.257
Everything.

01:17:16.558 --> 01:17:19.057
It's like a song.

01:17:19.059 --> 01:17:20.793
I bet
there's only one thing

01:17:20.795 --> 01:17:22.497
that can understand this.

01:17:23.898 --> 01:17:25.334
Godzilla.

01:17:29.203 --> 01:17:31.337
Yeah, I got it.

01:17:31.339 --> 01:17:33.608
Picking up a reply.
Bringing it up.

01:17:39.046 --> 01:17:41.148
He's still alive.

01:17:43.318 --> 01:17:47.186
So, her and Godzilla,
they're like...

01:17:47.188 --> 01:17:48.553
They got a thing going on?

01:17:48.555 --> 01:17:50.490
That's kind of
messed up, right?

01:17:50.492 --> 01:17:53.225
Symbiotic relationships
between two different species

01:17:53.227 --> 01:17:56.160
aren't all that uncommon.

01:17:56.162 --> 01:17:57.696
Can you track him?

01:17:57.698 --> 01:18:00.669
No. Signal's too weak.

01:18:02.269 --> 01:18:03.739
But maybe she can.

01:18:07.942 --> 01:18:10.011
How many nukes do you have?

01:18:10.778 --> 01:18:12.710
Why?

01:18:12.712 --> 01:18:14.315
We could help him.

01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:22.521
This category
six hurricane over D.C.

01:18:22.523 --> 01:18:24.557
is where King Ghidorah
is nesting.

01:18:24.559 --> 01:18:26.625
Working with all four branches
of the military,

01:18:26.627 --> 01:18:28.227
this will be a joint operation

01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:30.628
to lure it away
from the mainland,

01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:33.298
<i>so that we can continue
evacuations long enough</i>

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:36.037
<i>for our submersible team
to complete its mission.</i>

01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:43.508
So this plan is what you would
call a "long shot," right?

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:45.244
What do those nerds
think they're gonna do

01:18:45.246 --> 01:18:46.945
down there
with a bunch of nukes?

01:18:46.947 --> 01:18:48.547
You ain't hear 'em, Griffin?

01:18:48.549 --> 01:18:51.086
They wanna bring Godzilla
back from the dead.

01:18:57.692 --> 01:19:00.093
<i>We'll be out of range
while you're down there,</i>

01:19:00.095 --> 01:19:01.660
<i>but a squadron
will stay behind</i>

01:19:01.662 --> 01:19:02.927
<i>to keep an eye out for you.</i>

01:19:02.929 --> 01:19:04.297
<i>Appreciate it.</i>

01:19:04.299 --> 01:19:05.597
<i>All righty, Bowman,</i>

01:19:05.599 --> 01:19:07.033
let's take her down.

01:19:07.035 --> 01:19:09.636
Dive the ship.
Make depth 150.

01:19:09.638 --> 01:19:10.902
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:19:10.904 --> 01:19:12.370
<i>Thanks, Sam.</i>

01:19:12.372 --> 01:19:13.642
<i>We'll need it.</i>

01:19:39.433 --> 01:19:41.336
What time is it?

01:19:43.871 --> 01:19:46.173
Time to get a new watch.

01:19:47.474 --> 01:19:50.642
Andrew's favorite joke.

01:19:50.644 --> 01:19:52.678
You never took that watch
out of your pocket

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.715
without him asking
that question.

01:19:58.251 --> 01:20:01.454
You told me five years ago,

01:20:01.456 --> 01:20:04.793
I'd be trying to save
the thing that took my son,

01:20:05.626 --> 01:20:06.892
that would be the only way

01:20:06.894 --> 01:20:08.194
to save the family
I have left...

01:20:08.196 --> 01:20:10.428
Sometimes,

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:13.531
the only way to heal
our wounds is to make peace

01:20:13.533 --> 01:20:16.835
with the demons
who created them.

01:20:16.837 --> 01:20:18.370
You really believe that?

01:20:18.372 --> 01:20:19.907
Don't you?

01:20:20.974 --> 01:20:22.477
Isn't that why you are here?

01:20:25.746 --> 01:20:29.914
There are some things beyond
our understanding, Mark.

01:20:29.916 --> 01:20:33.820
We must accept them
and learn from them,

01:20:33.822 --> 01:20:35.788
because these moments
of crisis

01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:38.727
are also potential
moments of faith.

01:20:39.827 --> 01:20:41.060
A time

01:20:41.062 --> 01:20:44.565
when we either come together
or fall apart.

01:20:46.567 --> 01:20:49.871
Nature always has
a way of balancing itself.

01:20:51.304 --> 01:20:53.307
The only question is,

01:20:55.076 --> 01:20:58.313
what part will we play?

01:20:59.647 --> 01:21:01.713
Did you just make that up?

01:21:01.715 --> 01:21:02.714
No.

01:21:02.716 --> 01:21:05.519
I read it
in a fortune cookie once.

01:21:07.287 --> 01:21:09.456
A really long fortune cookie.

01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:15.962
Status of the ship?

01:21:15.964 --> 01:21:17.495
Some sort of vortex, Captain.

01:21:17.497 --> 01:21:19.733
It's dragging us.
1600 feet till impact.

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:27.039
800 feet.

01:21:27.041 --> 01:21:28.473
Emergency blow! 200 feet!

01:21:28.475 --> 01:21:30.174
One hundred!

01:21:30.176 --> 01:21:31.878
Twenty-five!

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.949
Brace for impact!

01:22:52.393 --> 01:22:54.560
Argo, <i>this is</i> U.S.S. Brody

01:22:54.562 --> 01:22:56.395
<i>en route
to evacuation perimeter.</i>

01:22:56.397 --> 01:23:00.402
<i>Weapons hot. Ready to engage
Titans on your command.</i>

01:23:01.836 --> 01:23:02.968
Jesus.

01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:05.637
It's like
the whole sky's alive.

01:23:07.241 --> 01:23:08.710
That's because it is.

01:23:11.377 --> 01:23:13.380
Here we go.

01:23:16.651 --> 01:23:18.016
Status report.

01:23:18.018 --> 01:23:19.819
Can't fix our position.
GPS is down.

01:23:19.821 --> 01:23:22.120
But inertial says we're...

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:23.990
600 miles from departure.

01:23:23.992 --> 01:23:25.124
That can't be.

01:23:25.126 --> 01:23:26.624
I knew it, man!

01:23:26.626 --> 01:23:29.794
The vortex was a tunnel
into the Hollow Earth.

01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:32.030
It's a subterranean
tunnel system

01:23:32.032 --> 01:23:33.566
that connects
the entire planet.

01:23:33.568 --> 01:23:34.866
It doesn't matter.
I knew I was right.

01:23:34.868 --> 01:23:37.703
- I told you, Chen!
- Shut up, Rick.

01:23:37.705 --> 01:23:39.808
One second emergency
blow forward.

01:23:49.416 --> 01:23:51.350
Doctor?

01:23:51.352 --> 01:23:53.421
Launch probes.

01:24:06.533 --> 01:24:09.069
Range 1,000 meters.

01:24:10.203 --> 01:24:11.973
Camera good.

01:24:12.607 --> 01:24:14.973
Holding range.

01:24:14.975 --> 01:24:17.010
Steady.

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:22.080
Jesus.

01:24:22.082 --> 01:24:23.484
Pan right.

01:24:48.108 --> 01:24:49.540
Looks Egyptian.

01:24:49.542 --> 01:24:50.910
Or Roman.

01:24:50.912 --> 01:24:52.511
No, this is
something different.

01:24:52.513 --> 01:24:55.082
This is... This is way older.

01:25:04.992 --> 01:25:06.460
Oh, my.

01:25:16.037 --> 01:25:18.637
All of the legends,

01:25:18.639 --> 01:25:20.705
the stories,

01:25:20.707 --> 01:25:21.941
they are true.

01:25:21.943 --> 01:25:24.110
They really were
the first gods.

01:25:24.112 --> 01:25:26.044
If only the earth
and stones could speak,

01:25:26.046 --> 01:25:28.379
the stories
they could tell us.

01:25:28.381 --> 01:25:29.848
Doctor Stanton,

01:25:29.850 --> 01:25:31.450
any sign of <i>Gojira?</i>

01:25:31.452 --> 01:25:35.387
Yeah, the probe is
picking up a radioactive blob,

01:25:35.389 --> 01:25:37.459
just past that ridge.

01:25:38.259 --> 01:25:40.758
Set a course.

01:25:47.201 --> 01:25:49.066
<i>Attention, please.</i>

01:25:49.068 --> 01:25:51.303
<i>Martial law
has now been instated</i>

01:25:51.305 --> 01:25:52.838
<i>by order of the President.</i>

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.405
<i>The greater Boston area</i>

01:25:54.407 --> 01:25:56.741
<i>is now under control
of the U.S. Military.</i>

01:25:56.743 --> 01:25:59.978
<i>All citizens to report to
the nearest evacuation center</i>

01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:01.847
<i>for immediate transport.</i>

01:26:01.849 --> 01:26:04.216
<i>I repeat, all citizens</i>

01:26:04.218 --> 01:26:06.084
<i>are to report
to the nearest evacuation...</i>

01:26:06.086 --> 01:26:07.919
<i>Massive
storms and other disasters</i>

01:26:07.921 --> 01:26:09.487
<i>triggered by the Titans</i>

01:26:09.489 --> 01:26:11.390
<i>have forced millions
to flee major cities.</i>

01:26:11.392 --> 01:26:14.927
<i>And with D.C. hit hard
by a category six hurricane</i>

01:26:14.929 --> 01:26:17.295
<i>that has left the capital
completely flooded,</i>

01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:21.299
<i>this is the single greatest
disaster in human history.</i>

01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:24.837
<i>The grim search continues,
as people around the world</i>

01:26:24.839 --> 01:26:26.405
<i>sift through the debris
of leveled homes</i>

01:26:26.407 --> 01:26:28.472
<i>in the hope of finding
missing loved ones.</i>

01:26:28.474 --> 01:26:30.342
<i>And though this sight
is heartbreaking,</i>

01:26:30.344 --> 01:26:32.677
<i>it is unfortunately
nothing unique.</i>

01:26:32.679 --> 01:26:34.879
<i>Cities around the globe
have fallen</i>

01:26:34.881 --> 01:26:36.582
<i>under the wake
of what many are calling</i>

01:26:36.584 --> 01:26:38.987
<i>"The Rise of the Titans."</i>

01:26:44.559 --> 01:26:46.491
I think we should stop.

01:26:46.493 --> 01:26:47.993
Why?

01:26:47.995 --> 01:26:49.994
'Cause I still wanna
have kids one day.

01:26:49.996 --> 01:26:52.763
Preferably without flippers.

01:26:52.765 --> 01:26:54.969
All stop. Hover the ship.

01:27:04.278 --> 01:27:05.613
Whoa.

01:27:06.546 --> 01:27:09.181
We got O2, CO2, and methane.

01:27:09.183 --> 01:27:11.886
It looks like there's some
sort of air pocket in there.

01:27:24.465 --> 01:27:25.664
My God.

01:27:25.666 --> 01:27:27.068
Zilla.

01:27:28.336 --> 01:27:30.735
- And goodnight, Gracie.
- Pull up the last frame.

01:27:30.737 --> 01:27:32.103
- Yup.
- There.

01:27:32.105 --> 01:27:33.871
The source of the radiation.

01:27:33.873 --> 01:27:35.740
That's why
he returned here.

01:27:35.742 --> 01:27:37.610
He's feeding,

01:27:37.612 --> 01:27:39.247
regenerating.

01:27:40.313 --> 01:27:42.282
This is his home.

01:27:43.384 --> 01:27:46.485
This is how
he's survived for so long.

01:27:46.487 --> 01:27:49.753
Always adapting, evolving.

01:27:49.755 --> 01:27:50.989
It's incredible.

01:27:50.991 --> 01:27:53.659
So,
dude's got this covered.

01:27:53.661 --> 01:27:55.427
Right?
He just needs a little nap.

01:27:55.429 --> 01:27:56.529
No.

01:27:56.531 --> 01:27:58.530
This process could take years.

01:27:58.532 --> 01:28:00.164
We have to proceed as planned.

01:28:00.166 --> 01:28:01.232
Hang on.

01:28:01.234 --> 01:28:03.668
We're gonna launch
a nuclear torpedo

01:28:03.670 --> 01:28:06.103
in order to revive
a giant monster.

01:28:06.105 --> 01:28:07.905
Okay, this is...
This is not like

01:28:07.907 --> 01:28:09.508
we're just jump-starting
a car.

01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:11.209
We have another complication.

01:28:11.211 --> 01:28:13.777
Our weapons systems were
damaged during the crash.

01:28:13.779 --> 01:28:14.847
We can't launch.

01:28:14.849 --> 01:28:16.714
Can it be repaired?

01:28:16.716 --> 01:28:18.417
I'm afraid not.

01:28:18.419 --> 01:28:21.986
Okay. What if
we go inside, set a timer,

01:28:21.988 --> 01:28:23.655
and blow up
the warhead manually?

01:28:23.657 --> 01:28:27.526
No way. If the heat doesn't
fry you, the radiation will.

01:28:31.032 --> 01:28:32.231
I'll go.

01:28:32.233 --> 01:28:33.832
What the hell does that mean?

01:28:33.834 --> 01:28:35.600
There must be another way.

01:28:35.602 --> 01:28:37.171
There's no time for debate.

01:28:38.572 --> 01:28:40.141
I'll go.

01:28:58.157 --> 01:29:00.026
<i>Argo,</i> we are red on ammo

01:29:00.028 --> 01:29:01.694
<i>and low on fuel. We can't
take much more of this!</i>

01:29:01.696 --> 01:29:04.696
Copy, copy. Just hold them off
as long as you can.

01:29:04.698 --> 01:29:05.797
Colonel,
take a look at this.

01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:06.899
All the Titans have stopped.

01:29:11.971 --> 01:29:14.405
What the hell
has gotten into them now?

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:22.847
<i>It does
appear as if the attacks</i>

01:29:22.849 --> 01:29:24.517
<i>have ceased
for the time being,</i>

01:29:24.519 --> 01:29:27.518
<i>with the creatures going
from destructive to docile</i>

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:28.920
<i>within minutes.</i>

01:29:28.922 --> 01:29:31.021
<i>Now, no one is sure
how or why,</i>

01:29:31.023 --> 01:29:33.592
<i>but this seems to be
happening simultaneously</i>

01:29:33.594 --> 01:29:35.459
<i>around the world.</i>

01:29:37.363 --> 01:29:39.231
What's going on?

01:29:39.233 --> 01:29:40.768
The ORCA.

01:29:41.367 --> 01:29:43.234
What?

01:29:43.236 --> 01:29:46.006
I wonder
who could have done this.

01:29:50.443 --> 01:29:52.212
Maddie?

01:29:59.886 --> 01:30:01.755
Maddie.

01:30:05.593 --> 01:30:07.759
First contact,
you're gonna start

01:30:07.761 --> 01:30:09.695
losing your long-range vision.

01:30:09.697 --> 01:30:10.995
When you surface,

01:30:10.997 --> 01:30:12.396
your motor skills
are gonna start to fade,

01:30:12.398 --> 01:30:14.600
but I put a helioxed mixture
in the tank,

01:30:14.602 --> 01:30:18.439
which should help you
stay stable a little longer.

01:30:19.907 --> 01:30:22.477
It was an honor, man.

01:30:36.756 --> 01:30:38.492
Thank you.

01:30:42.929 --> 01:30:44.798
My notes.

01:30:47.367 --> 01:30:49.035
Are you sure?

01:30:50.705 --> 01:30:53.438
He fought for us, died for us.

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:57.545
He's not only proof
that coexistence is possible,

01:30:59.013 --> 01:31:02.315
he is the key to it.

01:31:05.085 --> 01:31:08.189
Take care of them, Mark.

01:32:10.651 --> 01:32:13.584
Bowman, take us out, fast.

01:32:13.586 --> 01:32:15.223
Aye, Captain.

01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:19.893
He's clear.

01:35:12.366 --> 01:35:13.998
You all right?

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.302
Bowman, send a distress
message to the <i>Argo.</i>

01:35:17.304 --> 01:35:19.340
Aye, Captain.

01:35:36.756 --> 01:35:38.792
See anything?

01:36:45.992 --> 01:36:47.595
Nobody move!

01:37:24.497 --> 01:37:26.899
Are you okay?

01:37:26.901 --> 01:37:28.499
I know how to find 'em.

01:37:34.073 --> 01:37:37.408
I know how to find 'em!

01:37:37.410 --> 01:37:39.712
Let's make him proud
and not screw this up.

01:37:41.915 --> 01:37:43.048
How did he, uh...

01:37:43.050 --> 01:37:44.351
By saving us.

01:37:47.487 --> 01:37:48.853
Sam, what've we got going on?

01:37:48.855 --> 01:37:50.888
We think
Emma activated the ORCA

01:37:50.890 --> 01:37:51.957
somewhere near Boston.

01:37:51.959 --> 01:37:53.357
That's why Ghidorah
and Godzilla

01:37:53.359 --> 01:37:55.026
are both headed that way now.

01:37:55.028 --> 01:37:56.927
But we haven't been able to
pinpoint the exact location

01:37:56.929 --> 01:37:59.030
without the missing piece
of the ORCA signal.

01:37:59.032 --> 01:38:00.699
I've got the missing piece.

01:38:00.701 --> 01:38:02.734
It's Godzilla, right?

01:38:02.736 --> 01:38:04.572
- I know we already tried.
- It's not Godzilla.

01:38:05.339 --> 01:38:06.471
It's us.

01:38:06.473 --> 01:38:08.172
What do you mean "us"?

01:38:08.174 --> 01:38:10.441
Emma combined the bioacoustics
of Godzilla with a human.

01:38:10.443 --> 01:38:12.243
That's how she made
the signal for the ORCA.

01:38:12.245 --> 01:38:14.346
The creatures just think
it's another apex predator.

01:38:14.348 --> 01:38:15.914
Well, that makes sense.

01:38:15.916 --> 01:38:17.382
I mean, we are a bunch of
horny murderous carnivores.

01:38:17.384 --> 01:38:19.016
Yeah, that's real poetic.
Now what?

01:38:19.018 --> 01:38:22.152
We track it, we find it,
and we get my daughter back.

01:38:22.154 --> 01:38:25.589
What about Moe, Larry,
and Curly over here?

01:38:25.591 --> 01:38:27.558
Godzilla will bring balance.

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:31.362
Oh, I get it. A little
Serizawa let-'em-fight action.

01:38:31.364 --> 01:38:33.531
I used to love it
when he said that.

01:38:33.533 --> 01:38:36.368
No. This time,
we join the fight.

01:38:40.206 --> 01:38:41.638
What do you think
you're doing?

01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:43.173
I don't have time
to argue about this, Jonah.

01:38:43.175 --> 01:38:44.241
I'm getting Maddie back.

01:38:44.243 --> 01:38:46.210
Not with my men, you're not.

01:38:46.212 --> 01:38:48.713
Emma, you said this was about
the greater good.

01:38:48.715 --> 01:38:52.116
That the planet deserved
a clean slate.

01:38:52.118 --> 01:38:53.351
But now you're prepared

01:38:53.353 --> 01:38:54.619
to put all our lives in danger

01:38:54.621 --> 01:38:55.654
because your little girl
is missing.

01:38:55.656 --> 01:38:56.887
The ORCA is with...

01:38:56.889 --> 01:38:58.490
The ORCA
no longer matters.

01:38:58.492 --> 01:39:01.328
Man does not control
the laws of nature.

01:39:02.295 --> 01:39:03.997
And neither do you.

01:39:13.607 --> 01:39:18.977
I already lost one child.
I'm not losing another.

01:39:18.979 --> 01:39:20.981
I have to fix this.

01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:23.450
Let her go.

01:39:25.285 --> 01:39:27.488
We have everything we need.

01:41:29.142 --> 01:41:30.778
Oh, shit!

01:43:00.632 --> 01:43:02.933
Okay, we've zeroed in on
the last ping from the ORCA.

01:43:02.935 --> 01:43:04.602
Fenway Park, dead ahead.

01:43:04.604 --> 01:43:05.904
<i>We'll lay cover fire
to keep Ghidorah distracted.</i>

01:43:05.906 --> 01:43:07.608
Copy that.

01:43:09.843 --> 01:43:12.112
Colonel, all squadrons
are locked on target.

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:15.282
For Serizawa.

01:43:49.215 --> 01:43:51.883
Is it just me
or has he been working out?

01:43:51.885 --> 01:43:54.052
Are you kidding me?

01:43:54.054 --> 01:43:55.518
Serizawa's got
that lizard juiced!

01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:57.088
Damn right.

01:43:58.358 --> 01:44:00.790
Oh, boy.
Godzilla's radiation levels

01:44:00.792 --> 01:44:02.427
are going through the roof.

01:44:02.429 --> 01:44:04.962
We got about 12 minutes
before he goes thermonuclear.

01:44:04.964 --> 01:44:06.567
What do you mean?

01:44:08.033 --> 01:44:09.500
I'm saying
in about 12 minutes,

01:44:09.502 --> 01:44:11.802
it's gonna be a bad day
to be a Red Sox fan.

01:44:13.206 --> 01:44:14.972
Okay, guys,
you need to find the ORCA,

01:44:14.974 --> 01:44:16.807
get Madison,
and get the hell out of there.

01:44:16.809 --> 01:44:18.442
<i>Whatever Serizawa did
to Godzilla</i>

01:44:18.444 --> 01:44:20.078
<i>worked a little too well.</i>

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:21.812
<i>'Cause he's about to explode
like an atom bomb.</i>

01:44:21.814 --> 01:44:23.013
Roger that.

01:44:23.015 --> 01:44:24.684
Prepare for landing.

01:44:45.772 --> 01:44:47.972
Go, go, go!

01:44:47.974 --> 01:44:50.408
- Spread out!
- Flank left!

01:44:50.410 --> 01:44:51.612
On me!

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:03.924
Madison!

01:45:05.892 --> 01:45:08.362
I got something!
Over here.

01:45:09.362 --> 01:45:10.697
Come check this out!

01:45:13.398 --> 01:45:15.065
Are you all right?

01:45:15.067 --> 01:45:18.835
I found the ORCA, sir,
it looks pretty banged up!

01:45:18.837 --> 01:45:20.640
No sign of your daughter.

01:45:26.946 --> 01:45:28.411
She's not here!

01:45:28.413 --> 01:45:29.713
We gotta get out of here!

01:45:29.715 --> 01:45:30.916
Let's go!

01:46:46.326 --> 01:46:47.327
Get in!

01:46:49.828 --> 01:46:51.529
Incoming!

01:46:53.934 --> 01:46:54.999
Get in!

01:46:55.001 --> 01:46:57.234
Griffin, you all right?

01:46:57.236 --> 01:46:58.703
Martinez, let's get her up.

01:47:07.647 --> 01:47:08.945
Where's Madison?

01:47:08.947 --> 01:47:09.980
I don't know.
I thought she was there!

01:47:09.982 --> 01:47:11.218
Well, she's not there!

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:14.918
Take it easy!

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.989
- Get that side.
- Okay, okay.

01:47:19.024 --> 01:47:20.393
Look out!

01:47:22.495 --> 01:47:23.828
I hope you're as good

01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:25.096
at finding her
as you are losing her.

01:47:25.098 --> 01:47:26.798
I didn't lose her,
she ran away.

01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:27.865
Well, gee, I wonder why!

01:47:27.867 --> 01:47:29.100
I can't blame that kid.

01:47:29.102 --> 01:47:30.767
If I had these two
for parents,

01:47:30.769 --> 01:47:32.238
I'd have run away
from home, too.

01:47:35.741 --> 01:47:37.074
What did you just say?

01:47:37.076 --> 01:47:38.875
If I had the two of you
for parents,

01:47:38.877 --> 01:47:40.546
I'd run away from home, too.

01:47:41.813 --> 01:47:42.879
Home.

01:48:55.487 --> 01:48:58.254
Godzilla's radiation's
reaching critical mass.

01:48:58.256 --> 01:49:00.191
Six minutes until he blows.

01:49:00.193 --> 01:49:02.128
Order all remaining craft
to retreat!

01:50:13.366 --> 01:50:15.167
Maddie!

01:50:16.001 --> 01:50:17.435
Madison!

01:50:17.437 --> 01:50:19.637
Maddie!

01:50:19.639 --> 01:50:21.405
Madison!

01:50:21.407 --> 01:50:23.606
Madison!

01:50:23.608 --> 01:50:26.011
Madison!

01:50:29.614 --> 01:50:30.684
Emma!

01:50:31.885 --> 01:50:32.950
Maddie!

01:50:32.952 --> 01:50:34.017
Martinez!

01:50:34.019 --> 01:50:36.119
We got it. On three.

01:50:36.121 --> 01:50:38.058
One, two, three...

01:50:40.059 --> 01:50:41.428
Lift together.

01:50:56.643 --> 01:50:58.377
Oh, my baby.

01:50:59.211 --> 01:51:00.844
Is she breathing?

01:51:00.846 --> 01:51:02.213
Mark, is she breathing?

01:51:02.215 --> 01:51:03.416
Maddie.

01:51:08.188 --> 01:51:09.522
Maddie.

01:51:12.024 --> 01:51:13.223
Maddie.

01:51:13.225 --> 01:51:14.825
Mom.

01:51:14.827 --> 01:51:17.061
- Dad.
- Shh.

01:51:17.063 --> 01:51:19.366
- Mom. Mom.
- We're here.

01:53:11.175 --> 01:53:12.477
Roger that.

01:53:12.479 --> 01:53:13.977
Osprey's coming
in two minutes.

01:53:13.979 --> 01:53:16.279
We gotta work fast.

01:53:16.281 --> 01:53:17.684
To do what?

01:53:20.486 --> 01:53:21.752
You sure about this?

01:53:21.754 --> 01:53:23.486
It's the only way
to save him.

01:53:23.488 --> 01:53:25.188
We fix it, get on the osprey

01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:26.790
and draw that thing away
from Godzilla.

01:53:26.792 --> 01:53:28.827
Buy him time to get back
on his feet.

01:53:40.239 --> 01:53:41.905
Mark, you've seen
what that thing can do.

01:53:41.907 --> 01:53:44.710
I know. It'll be tight, but
we have to take that chance.

01:53:51.584 --> 01:53:52.850
Are you good to go?

01:53:52.852 --> 01:53:53.918
Yes.

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:55.752
All right. One, two,

01:53:55.754 --> 01:53:56.820
three.

01:54:00.792 --> 01:54:01.991
That's it.

01:54:01.993 --> 01:54:03.160
That's it!

01:54:09.033 --> 01:54:10.636
Come on, Griff. We got you.

01:54:13.304 --> 01:54:14.972
Come on, Emma. Let's go.

01:54:14.974 --> 01:54:16.306
Okay. Take her. Take her!

01:54:16.308 --> 01:54:17.740
I still have to activate it.

01:54:17.742 --> 01:54:18.609
What?

01:54:18.611 --> 01:54:20.246
I'm right behind you. Go!

01:54:33.058 --> 01:54:34.491
Let's go, let's go!

01:54:34.493 --> 01:54:35.694
Mom!

01:54:36.962 --> 01:54:38.027
Mom!

01:54:38.029 --> 01:54:39.463
Come on, Maddie!

01:54:39.465 --> 01:54:41.467
Go, go, go!

01:54:45.504 --> 01:54:47.204
You got any pain anywhere
besides your leg?

01:54:54.179 --> 01:54:55.277
We gotta lift off, now!

01:54:55.279 --> 01:54:56.715
Wait!

01:55:06.358 --> 01:55:08.292
Emma, let's go!
Come on!

01:55:08.294 --> 01:55:09.662
Mom!

01:55:18.304 --> 01:55:19.639
Mom.

01:55:20.471 --> 01:55:22.138
I love you.

01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:24.243
No.

01:55:25.344 --> 01:55:27.244
- No!
- Emma!

01:55:27.246 --> 01:55:29.545
Mom!

01:56:06.117 --> 01:56:07.319
No.

01:56:09.154 --> 01:56:10.355
No.

01:56:27.973 --> 01:56:30.510
Mom!

01:56:56.501 --> 01:57:00.038
Long live the king.

01:59:18.143 --> 01:59:20.442
Jesus.

01:59:20.444 --> 01:59:22.612
Good thing he's on our side.

01:59:22.614 --> 01:59:24.550
For now.

01:59:26.084 --> 01:59:27.252
Look.

02:10:41.926 --> 02:10:44.360
It's a brave new world,
my friend.

02:10:44.362 --> 02:10:45.928
Such things as this

02:10:45.930 --> 02:10:49.399
become much more valuable
since the rise of the king.

02:10:49.401 --> 02:10:51.167
My men,
they don't ask for much.

02:10:51.169 --> 02:10:53.168
Can't fish here anymore.

02:10:53.170 --> 02:10:54.906
Everything's dead.

02:11:28.305 --> 02:11:30.509
We'll take it.

02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:40.420
