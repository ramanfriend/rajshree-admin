00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:15.157
Leaving this to come see you.

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.761
And I can't wait.

00:01:37.648 --> 00:01:38.782
Whew.

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:49.960
Taxi! Over here.

00:01:57.801 --> 00:01:58.769
Taxi!

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:01.838
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

00:02:01.972 --> 00:02:05.174
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:02:25.294 --> 00:02:26.697
- Gilpin!
- Ahh!

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.599
You still on the toothpaste?
Are you on your phone?

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:32.468
I'm just... I'm going home
for the holidays tonight, so...

00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:34.071
Does it look like
tonight to you?

00:02:34.203 --> 00:02:36.173
Because to me,
it looks like today.

00:02:36.305 --> 00:02:39.308
- Finish the toothpaste.
- Okay. Sorry.

00:03:49.613 --> 00:03:51.815
Dad, we're home!

00:03:51.948 --> 00:03:54.117
I'm in the kitchen!

00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:56.285
Jan, Spencer!

00:03:56.418 --> 00:03:57.988
In the kitchen!

00:04:00.257 --> 00:04:02.592
Dad, are you on a ladder?

00:04:02.726 --> 00:04:03.960
- What are you doing?
- Grandpa.

00:04:04.094 --> 00:04:05.427
- What's it look like?
- Get down.

00:04:05.562 --> 00:04:06.930
I'm changing your light bulb.

00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:09.132
I leave for 10 minutes,
you're climbing ladders?

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:10.967
Don't think
you should be doing that.

00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:12.836
You think I can't
change a light bulb?

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.437
- Okay.
- There.

00:04:15.572 --> 00:04:17.574
Ugh! No, no, no.

00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:19.408
- I got it. I'm fine.
- Okay.

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:21.443
Hey, kiddo!

00:04:21.578 --> 00:04:24.614
Hey, how's New York City?

00:04:24.748 --> 00:04:27.483
- It's great.
- How's school?

00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:29.653
It's okay. How you doing?

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:32.289
I'm terrific. I don't
even know what I'm doing here.

00:04:32.421 --> 00:04:33.990
You're recovering
from hip surgery.

00:04:34.124 --> 00:04:36.492
Meh! I'll be out
of here in no time.

00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:37.661
It's not a prison.

00:04:37.794 --> 00:04:39.428
I wanna get back
to my apartment.

00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:42.599
- Is that so terrible?
- Your apartment? It's terrible.

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:44.201
Is it really cold in here?

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:46.169
The downstairs heater
isn't working.

00:04:46.303 --> 00:04:49.606
- The guy's coming in the morning.
- It's like a goddamn icebox.

00:04:50.774 --> 00:04:52.008
Did you ever call Milo?

00:04:52.142 --> 00:04:53.442
What? No.

00:04:53.577 --> 00:04:56.012
Dad. He's called five times.
Just call him back.

00:04:56.146 --> 00:04:58.682
I'm not calling him back.
I don't wanna talk to him.

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:02.819
Come on, I'll help you
with your bags.

00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:06.556
Oh, you're staying in here.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.558
We're roommates.

00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:11.527
Yeah. I could just stay
downstairs on the couch.

00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:13.730
- What? Don't be ridiculous.
- If you want, yeah.

00:05:13.864 --> 00:05:15.832
It's a couple weeks.
It's gonna be fine.

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:18.068
Come on in.
Make yourself comfortable.

00:05:18.201 --> 00:05:21.071
- Oh! You're gonna...
- Whoa!

00:05:23.173 --> 00:05:25.675
- You okay?
- Don't tell your mother!

00:05:26.877 --> 00:05:30.280
This goes there. There.

00:05:30.412 --> 00:05:32.949
That's in there.

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.085
- All right, let's try it.
- Okay, let's see.

00:05:35.218 --> 00:05:37.354
All right, so there's that.

00:05:37.486 --> 00:05:39.222
There's this. There's this.

00:05:39.356 --> 00:05:42.659
The blue light, the red,
the green light.

00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:47.529
Oh, look at you two.
How sweet is this?

00:05:47.664 --> 00:05:50.901
Okay, I have to leave for work
before either of you gets up.

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:52.869
The heater guy's
coming in the morning.

00:05:53.003 --> 00:05:55.205
I'm gonna meet
my friends for brunch at 10.

00:05:55.338 --> 00:05:57.040
That'll be nice.
Where are you going?

00:05:57.173 --> 00:06:00.877
- Um... Nora's.
- What are you going there for?

00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.478
All the restaurants
in Brantford,

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:04.581
- you gotta go to that one?
- I didn't pick.

00:06:04.714 --> 00:06:07.050
What difference does it make?
It's been years.

00:06:07.183 --> 00:06:09.152
I love you, honey.
I'm so glad you're home.

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.553
Love you too, Mom.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.097
Getting old sucks. Don't let
anybody tell you any different.

00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:23.733
You still got
that little girlfriend?

00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:25.902
No.

00:06:26.036 --> 00:06:27.704
We're not together anymore.

00:06:27.837 --> 00:06:29.773
I don't think.

00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:31.775
Was it her or you?

00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:33.677
- It's complicated.
- Try me.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.680
We'll see
if I can understand.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:41.151
Well, when we
first got together,

00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:42.518
we were...

00:06:44.087 --> 00:06:47.824
sort of different people
than we are now.

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:51.728
I mean, last year was...

00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:53.596
amazing.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.598
I was a senior in high school.

00:06:55.732 --> 00:06:57.801
I had a girlfriend.

00:06:57.934 --> 00:07:01.805
Like, I finally figured out
who I was or something.

00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:04.040
Mm.

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:06.943
I wish I could just feel
like that again, I guess.

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:11.381
I don't know.

00:07:11.513 --> 00:07:13.515
Long-distance
relationships are hard.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.620
I mean, I know everybody says
that, but turns out it's true.

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:21.925
Can I give you a little advice?
Listen to me.

00:07:22.058 --> 00:07:25.128
Every single day
on every single subway car,

00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:27.831
there's lots of ladies
in New York City.

00:07:27.964 --> 00:07:32.602
And one in five of them, I would
marry, no questions asked.

00:07:32.736 --> 00:07:35.537
This is the best time
of your life.

00:07:35.672 --> 00:07:37.841
- It is?
- Yes, it is.

00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:40.910
So pull it together! It doesn't
get any better than this.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:43.847
It's all downhill from here.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:36.066
Bravestone.

00:09:32.355 --> 00:09:33.256
Hi!

00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:34.624
Yay, yay, yay!

00:09:34.757 --> 00:09:36.192
- Ooh!
- Oh, gosh, how are you?

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:39.095
- Oh, my God, you look amazing.
- Thank you.

00:09:39.229 --> 00:09:40.630
Ho, ho, ho!

00:09:40.763 --> 00:09:42.432
- Fridge.
- Fridge!

00:09:42.566 --> 00:09:43.933
- Come here.
- Ooh!

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:46.536
So we were building houses
for two months,

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:49.105
and then on the way home,
we stopped in Costa Rica,

00:09:49.239 --> 00:09:51.541
which was also amazing.

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:53.943
That is so awesome.
I am so happy for you.

00:09:54.077 --> 00:09:55.645
That is so cool.

00:09:55.778 --> 00:09:58.781
So, "M," that's what
we're supposed to call you now?

00:09:58.915 --> 00:10:01.184
You don't have to.
It's just a nickname.

00:10:01.317 --> 00:10:03.353
One of my college friends
gave me that.

00:10:03.486 --> 00:10:05.288
You don't have to call me that.

00:10:05.421 --> 00:10:07.457
M. I love it. It's so hot.

00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:09.959
- Okay.
- But you and Spencer,

00:10:10.093 --> 00:10:13.796
- you're still not...?
- Yeah. No. Um, we're...

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.932
We're still,
like, taking a break.

00:10:17.233 --> 00:10:19.302
Where is he, by the way?

00:10:38.288 --> 00:10:40.190
Eh, Christ.

00:10:40.323 --> 00:10:42.593
What do you want, Milo?

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.427
Nice to see you too.

00:10:46.564 --> 00:10:50.200
Yes, I'd love to come in
for a cup of coffee.

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:51.768
Thanks for asking.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.042
You mind if I make some eggs?

00:10:59.175 --> 00:11:00.743
Do whatever you want.
I don't care.

00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:02.879
Just hurry up.
I don't have all day.

00:11:03.012 --> 00:11:04.414
You going somewhere?

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.587
Have, um...?

00:11:09.719 --> 00:11:13.489
Have you been in touch
with Spencer much?

00:11:13.624 --> 00:11:14.857
Yeah...

00:11:16.627 --> 00:11:18.394
You know what?

00:11:18.528 --> 00:11:20.029
Not really, actually.

00:11:20.163 --> 00:11:23.433
I text him a lot, but
he doesn't always text me back.

00:11:23.567 --> 00:11:24.834
- I know.
- It's just...

00:11:24.968 --> 00:11:26.502
I've been crazed lately

00:11:26.637 --> 00:11:28.838
with, you know,
classes and practices,

00:11:28.972 --> 00:11:30.540
and I got games
on the weekends.

00:11:30.674 --> 00:11:33.711
Yeah. Totally. Totally.

00:11:33.843 --> 00:11:37.615
I've just... I've been... I've
been a little worried about him.

00:11:40.684 --> 00:11:44.220
Okay, look, where...?
Where is this guy? For real.

00:11:48.224 --> 00:11:49.660
Good?

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:52.663
- Meh.
- What do you mean, "Meh"?

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:55.231
Meh! What do you want already?

00:11:55.365 --> 00:11:56.833
You've been calling
and calling.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.402
You show up out of the blue
after 15 years.

00:11:59.535 --> 00:12:02.171
Why? 'Cause you wanna
make some eggs?

00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:09.178
You remember
when we first opened,

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:12.982
we had that
little dishwasher, Morris?

00:12:13.116 --> 00:12:14.884
Yeah, of course
I remember Morris.

00:12:15.018 --> 00:12:16.919
Worked the dinner shift.

00:12:17.053 --> 00:12:20.658
Six days a week,
2 in the morning most nights.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.827
- The dishwasher.
- Little Morris. Mm.

00:12:24.961 --> 00:12:27.765
He wouldn't even touch those
saucepans until he was done

00:12:27.897 --> 00:12:31.401
with every single utensil
in the bin.

00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:35.471
Yeah, the man knew his craft.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.107
Little Morris.

00:12:41.612 --> 00:12:43.212
Well, get... Wha...

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.148
Just get to it, would you?

00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:47.785
I mean, it's always
the scenic route with you.

00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:50.621
I know what you want,
you want to apologize.

00:12:50.754 --> 00:12:52.723
And I hate to tell you,
I'm not interested.

00:12:54.591 --> 00:12:56.326
You think I'm supposed
to apologize?

00:12:57.927 --> 00:12:58.895
Oh, heater guy.

00:13:01.831 --> 00:13:03.966
- Grandpa Eddie?
- Anthony?

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.168
Yes, sir, it's me.

00:13:05.301 --> 00:13:07.036
Anthony!

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.304
How are you?

00:13:08.438 --> 00:13:10.173
Come on in. Come on in.

00:13:13.176 --> 00:13:15.813
- How you doing?
- Oh, getting old sucks.

00:13:15.945 --> 00:13:17.815
Don't let anybody
tell you any different.

00:13:17.947 --> 00:13:20.784
Heh, heh. Oh, uh, this is
uh, Martha and-and Bethany.

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:22.619
This is Spencer's
grandfather, Eddie.

00:13:22.753 --> 00:13:25.288
Martha?
You're the little girlfriend.

00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:27.123
- Uh...
- Morning!

00:13:27.256 --> 00:13:29.492
Morning, sir.
Sorry to barge in on you.

00:13:29.626 --> 00:13:31.861
You're not barging.
He's barging.

00:13:31.994 --> 00:13:33.831
Milo Walker.

00:13:33.963 --> 00:13:37.166
Wait, Milo? Like...
Like Milo and Eddie's.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.001
- Pleased to meet you.
- Man, my dad said

00:13:39.135 --> 00:13:40.671
you guys had
the best restaurant.

00:13:40.804 --> 00:13:43.406
We were just there.
Well, it's called Nora's now.

00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:46.943
Pfft, Nora's.
It's barely even a restaurant.

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:48.846
It's more like
a breakfast place now.

00:13:50.848 --> 00:13:52.415
Were you with Spencer?

00:13:52.548 --> 00:13:55.184
No, we came here
looking for him, actually.

00:13:55.318 --> 00:13:57.420
You all hungry?
Eggs on the griddle.

00:13:57.554 --> 00:13:59.355
- Might have to take a look.
- Hey, man,

00:13:59.489 --> 00:14:01.257
you can do more
than take a look at it.

00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:03.192
All right, all right. My man.

00:14:05.528 --> 00:14:10.433
- Whoa. Do you need a hand?
- Do I look like I need a hand?

00:14:15.972 --> 00:14:17.373
Martha?

00:14:21.144 --> 00:14:22.178
Hey.

00:14:24.046 --> 00:14:25.915
Where is he?

00:14:35.692 --> 00:14:37.960
- Do you hear that?
- Yes.

00:14:43.332 --> 00:14:45.268
You hear something?

00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:47.336
It's probably the heater.
It's broken.

00:14:52.208 --> 00:14:53.976
How did it
even get here?

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.813
I don't know.

00:14:55.945 --> 00:14:57.848
Maybe he...
I don't know,

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.249
maybe he went back for it
or something?

00:15:01.652 --> 00:15:04.086
Is he trying
to fix it?

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.757
Why would anyone
try to fix that thing?

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.491
I don't know.

00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:11.662
I don't know. Maybe he went
to buy parts or something?

00:15:11.795 --> 00:15:13.664
Okay, look,
I'm calling him again.

00:15:13.797 --> 00:15:16.834
I'm sure everything's... fine.

00:15:36.319 --> 00:15:38.187
Fourteen texts
and four missed calls.

00:15:41.825 --> 00:15:43.326
I don't think he went out.

00:15:45.094 --> 00:15:46.128
I think...

00:15:47.997 --> 00:15:49.566
I think he went back in.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.870
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no...

00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:54.070
- What? No. Why...?
- Come on, man!

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:55.371
Why would he do that?

00:15:55.505 --> 00:15:57.139
Remember what it was like?

00:15:57.273 --> 00:15:59.810
- I got eaten by a fricking hippo!
- I got killed by a piece of cake!

00:15:59.943 --> 00:16:01.712
Guys, guys.

00:16:01.845 --> 00:16:04.514
How is he gonna get out?

00:16:04.648 --> 00:16:08.184
Uh, he's gotta take the...
The green jewel.

00:16:08.317 --> 00:16:10.687
And stick it back
in the statue thing.

00:16:10.821 --> 00:16:11.922
By himself?

00:16:27.503 --> 00:16:28.639
We gotta go get him.

00:16:28.772 --> 00:16:30.172
Are you crazy?

00:16:30.306 --> 00:16:32.508
- I'm coming with you.
- Are you out of your minds?

00:16:32.643 --> 00:16:35.344
We can do this. We've been
there. We know what to expect.

00:16:35.478 --> 00:16:37.480
I gotta stop hanging out
with white people.

00:16:37.614 --> 00:16:38.815
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:41.484
She's right. We played
before and we won.

00:16:41.618 --> 00:16:43.052
We barely survived!

00:16:43.185 --> 00:16:45.923
You know
he would do it for you.

00:16:46.055 --> 00:16:47.024
For any of us.

00:16:54.397 --> 00:16:57.034
Be careful.
It looks pretty busted.

00:17:02.405 --> 00:17:04.140
Welcome to Jumanji.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:08.444
What...? We haven't even
picked our guys yet!

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.379
What?

00:17:10.513 --> 00:17:14.785
Okay, okay. Here we go. Oh, I
hate this part. All right. Okay.

00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:19.422
This is not happening!

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.699
You guys?

00:17:32.569 --> 00:17:33.770
No!

00:17:52.556 --> 00:17:53.991
Am I...?

00:17:54.123 --> 00:17:56.125
Is it...? I can't believe...

00:17:57.259 --> 00:17:58.929
Oh!

00:18:01.932 --> 00:18:03.432
Oh, it's her.

00:18:03.567 --> 00:18:04.467
I'm her.

00:18:11.975 --> 00:18:13.142
Spencer.

00:18:14.243 --> 00:18:15.478
Spencer?

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.619
What in tarnation?

00:18:22.753 --> 00:18:24.688
Where am I?

00:18:24.821 --> 00:18:27.323
What the hell is this?

00:18:27.456 --> 00:18:30.326
Oh, my God.

00:18:30.459 --> 00:18:31.494
Eddie?

00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:37.000
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Milo Walker. Who are you?

00:18:37.134 --> 00:18:39.136
Milo?

00:18:39.268 --> 00:18:40.637
What on earth? What...?

00:18:41.772 --> 00:18:42.806
- What the...?
- Oh, my.

00:18:42.939 --> 00:18:44.007
Wait a minute.

00:18:44.141 --> 00:18:45.609
Oh, Lord.

00:18:45.742 --> 00:18:48.011
- This isn't happening.
- Pardon me?

00:18:48.145 --> 00:18:51.213
- Who are you?
- You're Spencer's grandfather.

00:18:51.347 --> 00:18:54.483
- Yeah, no kidding.
- And you are Milo.

00:18:54.618 --> 00:18:55.986
I certainly am.

00:18:56.119 --> 00:18:58.254
I'm Martha, Spencer's...

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:00.389
You're the little girlfriend?

00:19:00.523 --> 00:19:02.025
- Look out!
- What?

00:19:03.526 --> 00:19:06.395
- Ah! Oh, oh!
- Oh, Lord.

00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:09.398
That hurt like a goddamn...

00:19:09.532 --> 00:19:13.202
- Bethany?
- What? I'm not...

00:19:13.335 --> 00:19:15.204
No.

00:19:15.337 --> 00:19:18.875
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

00:19:19.009 --> 00:19:20.110
Yo!

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:25.082
Oh, no, no, no.
This can't be happening!

00:19:25.214 --> 00:19:26.116
Fridge?

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:28.250
Yes, I'm Fridge, goddamn it!

00:19:28.384 --> 00:19:30.352
The hell, man?

00:19:30.486 --> 00:19:33.724
Okay.
Okay, something went wrong.

00:19:33.857 --> 00:19:34.825
You think?

00:19:38.061 --> 00:19:40.163
Holy...

00:19:40.296 --> 00:19:42.331
Wait. If I'm...

00:19:42.465 --> 00:19:44.533
Then you...? Spencer?

00:19:44.668 --> 00:19:46.903
Why does everybody
keep calling me Spencer?

00:19:47.037 --> 00:19:51.575
No, that is Grandpa Eddie.
And that, heh... is Milo.

00:19:51.708 --> 00:19:53.110
Pleased to meet you.

00:19:53.242 --> 00:19:54.745
What?

00:19:54.878 --> 00:19:56.847
Then where's Bethany?
And where's Spencer?

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.547
I don't know! Okay?

00:19:58.682 --> 00:20:00.951
The game, it didn't
let us pick our avatars, so...

00:20:01.084 --> 00:20:02.919
- Because it's busted!
- Yeah, okay.

00:20:03.053 --> 00:20:04.386
Are we dead?

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.157
You know, I was just
wondering the same thing.

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:09.126
Did I die and turn into

00:20:09.258 --> 00:20:12.596
some kind of a small,
muscular Boy Scout?

00:20:12.729 --> 00:20:15.732
- We're not dead.
- So then what's going on here?

00:20:15.866 --> 00:20:18.001
Okay, this is gonna sound
very, uh, strange,

00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:21.104
but we are in
a video game called Jumanji,

00:20:21.238 --> 00:20:25.742
and we are in the bodies
of video game characters, heh.

00:20:25.876 --> 00:20:27.744
And we've been here before,
Fridge and I.

00:20:27.878 --> 00:20:29.579
- Last time, I was you.
- Mm.

00:20:29.713 --> 00:20:32.314
- Huh?
- We're in a game!

00:20:32.448 --> 00:20:34.584
We gotta find Spencer
'cause he's in here too.

00:20:34.718 --> 00:20:36.787
- Spencer?
- Yes.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.655
- He's here?
- Yes.

00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:40.389
Spencer, Eddie's grandson?

00:20:40.523 --> 00:20:42.291
Yes. Spencer.

00:20:42.424 --> 00:20:44.661
- He's here too?
- Yes!

00:20:44.795 --> 00:20:46.295
He's here,
and we gotta find him.

00:20:46.428 --> 00:20:48.799
So it's like
a hide-and-go-seek situation.

00:20:49.866 --> 00:20:51.400
I'm not "it."

00:20:51.534 --> 00:20:52.769
Hm...

00:20:56.072 --> 00:20:57.841
My hip feels
pretty good now.

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.146
Oh, my joints
feel like butter.

00:21:04.313 --> 00:21:06.850
- Oh, yeah, look at those.
- Wow.

00:21:06.983 --> 00:21:10.120
Look at these.
Look at what I got.

00:21:10.253 --> 00:21:13.623
- Uh, we have some issues here.
- You're telling me this?

00:21:13.757 --> 00:21:15.391
I'm the old fat dude.

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:17.661
I came back, and things
actually got worse.

00:21:17.794 --> 00:21:19.629
At least last time
I was still black.

00:21:22.666 --> 00:21:25.735
Well, look at
this little fella.

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:27.403
Hello there. Heh.

00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:29.706
Mr. Walker, don't get
too close to the water!

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.709
- Get away from there!
- I'm sorry, what'd you say now?

00:21:37.147 --> 00:21:38.849
Hey! Ahh!

00:21:40.917 --> 00:21:42.185
Get on out of here!

00:21:43.854 --> 00:21:45.055
What just happened?

00:21:45.188 --> 00:21:46.556
What the hell
was that thing?

00:21:49.793 --> 00:21:56.365
Well, that there
was a hippopotamus. Mm-hm.

00:21:56.498 --> 00:21:58.301
And they are awfully fast.

00:21:58.434 --> 00:22:01.171
Faster than a horse,
if you can believe that.

00:22:01.304 --> 00:22:04.741
And they've got
an awful ferocious bite.

00:22:04.875 --> 00:22:07.509
How about that?
You know, the funny thing is,

00:22:07.644 --> 00:22:09.779
I don't remember...

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:13.382
knowing much about hippos
until right now.

00:22:13.515 --> 00:22:14.918
You're a zoologist.

00:22:15.051 --> 00:22:18.722
- I'm sorry, what now?
- Are we in Florida?

00:22:18.855 --> 00:22:22.592
Just listen.
This is a dangerous place.

00:22:22.726 --> 00:22:23.960
Crazy dangerous.

00:22:24.094 --> 00:22:26.062
But Martha and I,
we've been here before.

00:22:26.196 --> 00:22:30.432
We know what we're doing. You
gotta stay alert all the time.

00:22:30.567 --> 00:22:34.571
If I'm near water, I got one eye
on the water, you hear me?

00:22:34.704 --> 00:22:37.107
You got to have eyes
in the back of your...

00:22:41.711 --> 00:22:43.545
Oh, God.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.250
What in the Sam Hill
just happened to him?

00:22:53.023 --> 00:22:55.225
Shut the front door.

00:22:55.358 --> 00:22:56.726
What the hell
happened to you?

00:22:58.895 --> 00:22:59.963
Damn!

00:23:03.066 --> 00:23:04.067
A plane?

00:23:05.101 --> 00:23:08.271
What? Come on! Follow me!

00:23:08.405 --> 00:23:10.307
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Follow us.

00:23:18.648 --> 00:23:20.449
Welcome to Jumanji.

00:23:20.583 --> 00:23:22.686
- Why is he in a plane?
- I don't know.

00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:24.854
Well, don't just stand there.
Hop in!

00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:31.861
Strap in.
There's no time to spare.

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:38.234
Dr. Bravestone,
famed archeologist

00:23:38.368 --> 00:23:40.136
and international explorer,

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.938
I'm so glad you've returned.

00:23:42.072 --> 00:23:44.741
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

00:23:44.874 --> 00:23:46.242
- You talking to me?
- Yes.

00:23:46.376 --> 00:23:48.510
Once again, Jumanji
is in great peril,

00:23:48.645 --> 00:23:49.846
and only you can help.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.648
Nigel, we're looking
for our friend.

00:23:51.781 --> 00:23:54.851
- Have you seen, like, anyone...?
- Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men,

00:23:54.985 --> 00:23:56.786
welcome to Jumanji.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.522
- "Killer of men"?
- Yeah, I, uh... I kill guys.

00:24:00.657 --> 00:24:02.292
I'm so glad you've returned.

00:24:02.425 --> 00:24:04.526
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

00:24:04.661 --> 00:24:07.130
- What's with this fella?
- My dearest Mouse,

00:24:07.263 --> 00:24:08.565
surely you remember me.

00:24:08.698 --> 00:24:10.367
Nigel Billingsly
at your service.

00:24:10.499 --> 00:24:13.470
Hey. Nigel,
I thought that was you.

00:24:13.603 --> 00:24:15.672
He's a... Uh, what is it called?

00:24:15.805 --> 00:24:19.009
- NPC, a non-player character.
- He's not a real person.

00:24:19.142 --> 00:24:21.745
He only has a limited
number of things he can say.

00:24:21.878 --> 00:24:24.381
Mm, my friend Carl
is just like that.

00:24:24.513 --> 00:24:26.016
Nigel, we're looking
for someone.

00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:27.584
Has anyone arrived
in Jumanji...?

00:24:27.717 --> 00:24:29.352
Jumanji is in great peril.

00:24:29.486 --> 00:24:32.255
It's all detailed in the letter
I sent you, Dr. Bravestone.

00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:34.657
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:36.259
Grandpa Eddie.

00:24:36.393 --> 00:24:38.661
- Do you have a letter?
- Do I have a letter?

00:24:38.795 --> 00:24:41.164
- Check your pockets.
- Why would I have a letter?

00:24:41.297 --> 00:24:42.732
Nigel here
wrote you a letter.

00:24:42.866 --> 00:24:44.501
I didn't get a letter
from this guy.

00:24:44.634 --> 00:24:46.403
But we are
in a video game, and...

00:24:46.535 --> 00:24:48.405
We're in a video game?

00:24:48.537 --> 00:24:49.572
We're gonna die.

00:24:49.706 --> 00:24:51.641
- We did die.
- Are we in hell?

00:24:51.775 --> 00:24:53.143
- I knew it.
- Oh, my God.

00:24:53.276 --> 00:24:55.045
It's detailed
in the letter I sent you,

00:24:55.178 --> 00:24:57.080
Dr. Bravestone.
You should read it aloud.

00:24:57.213 --> 00:25:00.083
I don't have a letter! How many
times I gotta tell you that?

00:25:00.216 --> 00:25:02.652
Oh, no, Eddie.
It's in your hand.

00:25:04.287 --> 00:25:05.755
Where did this come from?

00:25:05.889 --> 00:25:08.992
You got to pay attention
to what's in your hand.

00:25:09.125 --> 00:25:11.461
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

00:25:14.064 --> 00:25:16.900
"Dr. Bravestone,
it is my solemn hope

00:25:17.033 --> 00:25:20.103
that this letter finds you,
for again..."

00:25:20.236 --> 00:25:23.873
Jumanji is in grave danger.
We need your help at once.

00:25:24.007 --> 00:25:25.809
Whoa, what's going on here?

00:25:25.942 --> 00:25:28.111
It's a cutscene.
It's how we find...

00:25:28.244 --> 00:25:29.479
I'll explain afterwards.

00:25:29.612 --> 00:25:31.314
You see, our worst nightmare

00:25:31.448 --> 00:25:32.816
has come to pass,

00:25:32.949 --> 00:25:35.952
for Jurgen the Brutal
has returned.

00:25:36.086 --> 00:25:39.289
Indeed, that most vicious
Jumanjian conqueror is back.

00:25:40.457 --> 00:25:41.624
And he's brought with him

00:25:41.758 --> 00:25:43.561
his savage horde.

00:25:43.693 --> 00:25:47.430
They descended from their
fortress atop Mount Zhatmire

00:25:47.565 --> 00:25:51.569
and made their way south
to the Avian Province,

00:25:51.701 --> 00:25:54.304
home of the sacred
Falcon Jewel,

00:25:54.437 --> 00:25:56.706
worn around the neck
of the village elder.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.109
The Falcon is
the fertility jewel of Jumanji,

00:25:59.242 --> 00:26:00.977
and it has been guarded
by the people

00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:03.913
of the Avian Province
for hundreds of years.

00:26:04.047 --> 00:26:06.216
So long as the jewel
can see the sun,

00:26:06.349 --> 00:26:09.919
the waters will flow
and the land will flourish.

00:26:16.626 --> 00:26:17.961
Yeah!

00:26:26.604 --> 00:26:29.439
Many brave souls died that day,

00:26:29.573 --> 00:26:32.041
but Jurgen got
what he came for.

00:26:32.175 --> 00:26:34.477
He stowed the jewel
in darkness,

00:26:34.612 --> 00:26:36.279
hidden from the sun.

00:26:48.224 --> 00:26:49.826
A drought befell the land.

00:26:49.959 --> 00:26:52.028
The crops dried out and died.

00:26:52.162 --> 00:26:54.297
And if the jewel
is not returned soon,

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.166
it may be too late.

00:26:56.299 --> 00:26:57.767
Which is why we called for you

00:26:57.901 --> 00:26:59.769
and your brilliant associates.

00:26:59.903 --> 00:27:01.504
I understand
the enormous weight

00:27:01.639 --> 00:27:03.873
that this must carry for you,
Dr. Bravestone,

00:27:04.007 --> 00:27:06.676
how this adventure
is like no other,

00:27:06.809 --> 00:27:09.279
since it was Jurgen the Brutal

00:27:09.412 --> 00:27:11.615
who killed your parents.

00:27:14.751 --> 00:27:16.252
No, no, no, no!

00:27:18.855 --> 00:27:20.323
- Huh?
- He killed

00:27:20.456 --> 00:27:22.358
- Dr. Bravestone's parents?
- Indeed, he did.

00:27:22.492 --> 00:27:25.828
- When the doctor was just a boy.
- Oh, well, that's terrible.

00:27:25.962 --> 00:27:28.865
I can't say this enough:
We're in a video game.

00:27:28.998 --> 00:27:31.569
You must recover the jewel
from Jurgen the Brutal

00:27:31.701 --> 00:27:33.169
and show it to the sun.

00:27:33.303 --> 00:27:36.039
He's making his way north
across the desert now.

00:27:36.172 --> 00:27:39.008
Jurgen the Brutal.
Is that Barbara's boy?

00:27:39.142 --> 00:27:41.377
And remember, the goal
is to recover the loot.

00:27:41.511 --> 00:27:43.379
To wrest it from
the hands of the brute.

00:27:43.513 --> 00:27:45.048
And if you wish
to leave the game,

00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:47.483
you must save Jumanji
and call out its name.

00:27:47.618 --> 00:27:50.987
Excuse me. Who is Jumanji?

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.524
Well, if I was listening
correctly, that is her sister.

00:27:54.658 --> 00:27:56.059
Here's your map.

00:27:57.794 --> 00:28:00.530
Find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit.

00:28:00.664 --> 00:28:02.498
- Huh?
- I can't land here,

00:28:02.633 --> 00:28:04.200
so you're going
to have to drop in.

00:28:04.334 --> 00:28:05.735
- What?
- No, no. Nigel...

00:28:05.868 --> 00:28:07.437
- I'll get as low as I can.
- Hold on.

00:28:07.571 --> 00:28:08.905
- Get ready.
- What do you mean?

00:28:09.038 --> 00:28:09.906
We don't have parachutes.

00:28:10.039 --> 00:28:11.341
Shouldn't we have...? Ahh!

00:28:11.474 --> 00:28:13.243
- What the hell?
- Good luck.

00:28:13.376 --> 00:28:15.211
The future of Jumanji
is in your hands.

00:28:15.345 --> 00:28:17.213
Why did we take a plane
if there's nowhere to land?

00:28:17.347 --> 00:28:18.414
And go!

00:28:46.209 --> 00:28:48.311
The hell, man?

00:28:59.556 --> 00:29:00.624
Where are we?

00:29:00.758 --> 00:29:02.392
Where's the jungle?

00:29:02.525 --> 00:29:04.294
What are we doing here?

00:29:04.427 --> 00:29:06.296
We've got to keep it
together, okay?

00:29:06.429 --> 00:29:07.765
- "Keep it together"?
- Yes.

00:29:07.897 --> 00:29:09.299
This is
a whole new thing.

00:29:09.432 --> 00:29:11.568
Nobody said we'd have to do
a whole new thing.

00:29:11.702 --> 00:29:14.470
And by the way, what the hell
happened to Bethany?

00:29:34.957 --> 00:29:37.493
So, what part of New
Hampshire is this exactly?

00:29:37.628 --> 00:29:39.663
We're not
in New Hampshire, Milo.

00:29:39.797 --> 00:29:41.699
That's right. Exactly.
Not New Hampshire.

00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:43.701
- You're starting to get it now?
- Nope.

00:29:43.833 --> 00:29:46.302
I don't have the foggiest clue
what's going on here.

00:29:46.436 --> 00:29:48.471
That guy kept calling me
Dr. Braverman,

00:29:48.605 --> 00:29:50.239
which is the name
of my orthopedist.

00:29:50.373 --> 00:29:52.643
I'm thinking I just had
another hip surgery

00:29:52.776 --> 00:29:54.310
and now I'm coming out of it.

00:29:54.444 --> 00:29:57.380
Hey! Check this out!

00:30:02.852 --> 00:30:05.556
Okay.
We have to find Spencer.

00:30:05.689 --> 00:30:08.358
To do that, I think we have
to start playing the game.

00:30:08.491 --> 00:30:11.127
I'm sure that's what he did.
We find him,

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.963
finish the game,
and we go home.

00:30:14.097 --> 00:30:16.499
Ed, you okay?

00:30:16.633 --> 00:30:19.402
Would you look at me?

00:30:19.535 --> 00:30:21.404
I'm back.

00:30:21.537 --> 00:30:23.406
I haven't looked
like this since...

00:30:23.539 --> 00:30:24.842
Never.

00:30:24.974 --> 00:30:27.043
You looked like this never.

00:30:27.176 --> 00:30:29.412
What? When I was younger,
I was in great shape.

00:30:29.545 --> 00:30:31.381
I remember you
when you were younger,

00:30:31.514 --> 00:30:34.718
and... this is not
what you looked like.

00:30:34.852 --> 00:30:36.886
I think my eyes
are a different color.

00:30:37.019 --> 00:30:39.255
All of you
is a different color.

00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:43.192
It's a good look on me,
huh? Huh?

00:30:43.326 --> 00:30:45.596
Okay.
They're headed north.

00:30:45.729 --> 00:30:47.964
- Which way is north?
- I have no idea.

00:30:48.097 --> 00:30:51.735
- Well, you wanna check the map?
- Right. I'm the map guy now.

00:30:51.869 --> 00:30:55.839
"Find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit."

00:30:55.972 --> 00:30:58.709
Follow the flame
to the desert fruit.

00:30:58.842 --> 00:31:00.343
You know there's
nothing on that?

00:31:00.476 --> 00:31:01.678
He can see it,
you can't.

00:31:01.812 --> 00:31:03.781
Each place on the map
is a different level,

00:31:03.913 --> 00:31:06.249
and the levels
get harder as we go.

00:31:06.382 --> 00:31:08.284
This one is called...

00:31:08.418 --> 00:31:10.453
"Dunes."

00:31:10.587 --> 00:31:12.221
No shit.

00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:16.760
Who the hell is that?

00:31:21.497 --> 00:31:23.867
Oh, that's an ostrich.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.805
- Oh, no.
- Yes, indeed.

00:31:27.937 --> 00:31:31.575
That is an ostrich.

00:31:31.708 --> 00:31:34.645
The ostrich
is a flightless bird,

00:31:34.778 --> 00:31:37.013
one of 60 species.

00:31:37.146 --> 00:31:41.083
You got the penguin, you got
the emu, and you got the kiwi.

00:31:41.217 --> 00:31:44.120
Heh, heh, funny thing is,
I don't remember knowing...

00:31:44.253 --> 00:31:45.789
You're a zoologist.

00:31:45.923 --> 00:31:47.957
I was a zoologist last time.
It's important.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.259
Maybe if we could get through
this quicker.

00:31:50.393 --> 00:31:55.298
Well, another thing is, they can
run up to 45 miles per hour,

00:31:55.431 --> 00:31:59.068
which makes them the world's
fastest two-legged animal.

00:31:59.202 --> 00:32:01.805
Did you know that?
Fascinating.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.176
- What a magnificent creature.
- We should get out of here.

00:32:08.544 --> 00:32:10.446
What else do you know?

00:32:10.581 --> 00:32:12.148
Here's another
interesting fact.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.152
They have three stomachs.
How about that?

00:32:17.453 --> 00:32:20.691
Ah! Come on.
Beat it!

00:32:20.824 --> 00:32:22.458
Don't get so close.

00:32:22.593 --> 00:32:25.863
Just a bird, okay? Come on,
get moving. Get out of here.

00:32:25.995 --> 00:32:28.297
- Anything else we need to know?
- Beat it, bird.

00:32:28.431 --> 00:32:30.701
Another interesting thing
about the ostrich...

00:32:30.834 --> 00:32:32.803
I said scram,
you stupid bird!

00:32:32.936 --> 00:32:34.972
- ...is when threatened...
- Get out of here!

00:32:35.137 --> 00:32:36.573
...they attack.

00:32:39.175 --> 00:32:40.978
Oh, my!

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.681
- Eddie! Eddie!
- Oh!

00:32:44.815 --> 00:32:47.316
Where's Eddie? Is he dead?

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.986
- Yes.
- No. Yes, he died,

00:32:49.118 --> 00:32:50.854
but he's fine.

00:32:50.988 --> 00:32:53.891
Did I just kill Eddie...

00:32:54.023 --> 00:32:55.893
by talking too slow...

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.962
like he always said
I would?

00:33:10.206 --> 00:33:14.076
Why does everybody keep
dropping from the sky?

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:18.514
Nurse, I'm gonna need to see
Dr. Braverman right now, please.

00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:20.984
I'm not your nurse.
Okay, listen.

00:33:21.117 --> 00:33:25.321
These tattoos on our arms,
that is your life count.

00:33:25.454 --> 00:33:26.757
We each have three lives.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.358
You and Fridge
each have two left.

00:33:29.492 --> 00:33:31.028
If you lose all three,

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.797
listen to me,
it is game over.

00:33:33.931 --> 00:33:38.035
- That's it. You're dead.
- Dead like... "kaputski"?

00:33:38.167 --> 00:33:39.468
Yes.

00:33:39.603 --> 00:33:40.771
Kaputski.

00:33:46.043 --> 00:33:47.143
What the hell is that?

00:33:47.276 --> 00:33:48.979
- That's not good.
- Look.

00:33:57.721 --> 00:34:01.024
Oh, there's one more thing
about ostriches.

00:34:01.157 --> 00:34:02.091
Oh, no.

00:34:02.224 --> 00:34:03.292
Say it!

00:34:03.426 --> 00:34:05.729
They travel in herds.

00:34:10.767 --> 00:34:12.368
We gotta get out of here!

00:34:12.501 --> 00:34:15.038
- Dune buggies, let's go!
- Come on, come on! Shake a leg!

00:34:15.171 --> 00:34:16.673
- Hey, wait.
- Why am I so slow?

00:34:16.807 --> 00:34:18.274
Haul ass, girl. Let's go!

00:34:18.407 --> 00:34:20.043
- Come on, come on!
- I'm coming, Eddie.

00:34:20.176 --> 00:34:21.878
- Go.
- Do you see the key anywhere?

00:34:22.012 --> 00:34:24.648
- Okay, how do I do this?
- I've never driven one of these!

00:34:28.852 --> 00:34:30.419
Maybe under the dash.

00:34:31.755 --> 00:34:33.757
- Green button!
- Green button. Go.

00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:34.758
Go, go, go!

00:34:37.594 --> 00:34:38.527
Go, go.

00:34:47.971 --> 00:34:49.039
Oh, my God!

00:35:01.818 --> 00:35:02.919
Go.

00:35:03.053 --> 00:35:05.956
You are
a terrible driver.

00:35:06.089 --> 00:35:07.858
What are you talking about?
We're fine.

00:35:07.991 --> 00:35:10.192
Nobody fine. You... Oh! Oh, oh!

00:35:11.494 --> 00:35:13.597
Oh, no! Ahh, ahh!

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.966
Oh, help! Oh, oh!

00:35:16.099 --> 00:35:18.001
Hold on, Eddie.
Please don't let go.

00:35:18.135 --> 00:35:21.004
Ahh! Oh! Oh, wow!

00:35:21.138 --> 00:35:22.639
Oh, help. Ahh!

00:35:28.979 --> 00:35:31.815
Help. Eddie. Oh!

00:35:35.184 --> 00:35:37.154
Beat it!

00:35:37.286 --> 00:35:38.421
Get out of here!

00:35:42.826 --> 00:35:43.760
I think we lost them.

00:35:43.894 --> 00:35:44.895
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:36:01.078 --> 00:36:02.946
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:36:05.682 --> 00:36:06.917
Oh, no.

00:36:12.321 --> 00:36:13.222
- Ahh!
- What do we do?

00:36:13.355 --> 00:36:15.058
I don't know!

00:36:18.795 --> 00:36:20.564
Get in! Hurry!

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.076
Ha! Suckers!

00:36:40.416 --> 00:36:41.818
- Eddie...
- Uh-oh.

00:36:43.787 --> 00:36:47.224
- Oh, my...
- Whoa, whoa!

00:36:47.356 --> 00:36:50.227
- Oh, dude!
- Oh, dear.

00:36:52.596 --> 00:36:54.798
What do we do?

00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:55.932
What do we do?

00:37:00.369 --> 00:37:01.504
What are you doing?

00:37:01.638 --> 00:37:04.908
- Birds, birds, birds!
- Birds!

00:37:12.381 --> 00:37:15.451
- What the hell, man?
- They're flightless birds.

00:37:15.585 --> 00:37:18.955
This is a flightless
dune buggy!

00:37:19.089 --> 00:37:21.792
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.562
No, no, no!

00:37:25.695 --> 00:37:27.931
- We're not going to make it.
- We're gonna make it.

00:37:28.064 --> 00:37:30.133
- No, we're not!
- We're not gonna make it.

00:37:30.267 --> 00:37:31.433
We're gonna make it.

00:37:37.707 --> 00:37:39.341
We're not gonna make it.

00:37:49.986 --> 00:37:53.623
That was fantastic. Heh.

00:37:53.757 --> 00:37:55.324
- Oh, horrible driver.
- Whoo...

00:37:57.359 --> 00:38:00.630
Yeah, you see that, birds?
You don't mess with the kid.

00:38:00.764 --> 00:38:02.032
Right there!

00:38:06.335 --> 00:38:07.904
Did you see me?

00:38:08.038 --> 00:38:09.673
I was incredible.

00:38:09.806 --> 00:38:12.042
I mean, I saved you,
I saved you,

00:38:12.175 --> 00:38:16.613
I saved this guy from a bird
while I was driving a car.

00:38:16.746 --> 00:38:19.716
I was a machine.
I was relentless.

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.953
- I was fearless.
- Yes. Exactly. Fearless.

00:38:23.086 --> 00:38:26.189
That's Bravestone.
Okay, check this out.

00:38:28.325 --> 00:38:29.693
Oh, goodness.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.494
What the hell?

00:38:32.629 --> 00:38:34.197
It's your strengths
and weaknesses.

00:38:34.331 --> 00:38:35.632
I... I mean your avatar,

00:38:35.765 --> 00:38:38.668
Dr. Bravestone's,
strengths and weaknesses.

00:38:38.802 --> 00:38:40.536
"Fearless," check.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:43.073
"Speed. Climbing."
"Boomerang"?

00:38:44.341 --> 00:38:46.042
"Smoldering intensity"?

00:38:46.176 --> 00:38:48.912
- It's this stupid face you make.
- Huh?

00:38:52.514 --> 00:38:53.617
There it is.

00:38:54.985 --> 00:38:57.787
Ew! Ew! Old man.
Get it together.

00:38:57.921 --> 00:39:00.891
Eddie, you okay?
You having a heart attack?

00:39:01.024 --> 00:39:03.793
His whole left side is shutting
down. Eddie, look at me!

00:39:03.927 --> 00:39:06.528
- Yeah?
- There you go. Now you're back.

00:39:08.031 --> 00:39:10.066
"Weakness: switchblade."

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.569
Switchblade? Hey, that's new.

00:39:12.702 --> 00:39:14.738
Bravestone didn't
have weaknesses last time.

00:39:14.871 --> 00:39:16.606
Yeah,
bugged the hell out of me.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.275
I wonder if...

00:39:23.079 --> 00:39:26.683
- "Nunchucks"? That's new.
- Damn, that's a good list.

00:39:26.816 --> 00:39:29.753
Milo, push on your left,
like, chest area.

00:39:29.886 --> 00:39:32.622
- I'm sorry, what?
- Come on, man.

00:39:32.756 --> 00:39:34.190
Hey!

00:39:34.324 --> 00:39:36.393
Oh, I got one too. What...?

00:39:36.525 --> 00:39:40.931
My. "Zoology." That's what
you were talking about earlier.

00:39:41.064 --> 00:39:42.232
- Yes. Exactly.
- Yes.

00:39:42.365 --> 00:39:43.967
Your avatar is a zoologist.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.904
You know, my nephew Maxwell
is a veterinarian.

00:39:48.038 --> 00:39:50.173
- What a fascinating...
- "Linguistics"?

00:39:50.307 --> 00:39:52.976
- I didn't have that last time.
- The study of languages.

00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:55.578
Makes sense.
He studies the entire language

00:39:55.712 --> 00:39:57.180
on his way to the point.

00:39:57.314 --> 00:40:00.449
Anyway, he's 32. Or is he 35?

00:40:00.583 --> 00:40:01.751
Time does fly.

00:40:01.885 --> 00:40:03.452
Okay, let's get it over with.

00:40:07.924 --> 00:40:09.458
You gotta be kidding me.

00:40:09.592 --> 00:40:11.928
Well, geometry is...

00:40:12.062 --> 00:40:13.462
- Is new.
- Yeah.

00:40:13.596 --> 00:40:15.665
Who wouldn't wanna
be better at geometry?

00:40:15.799 --> 00:40:18.068
And for weaknesses,
"Endurance."

00:40:18.201 --> 00:40:22.005
And what else? Let's see,
"Heat, sun and sand."

00:40:24.874 --> 00:40:26.676
Shouldn't be a problem.
It's not like

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:29.946
we're in the middle of
a goddamn desert or anything.

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.649
What's the point of this guy?
Who even needs this guy?

00:40:32.782 --> 00:40:33.984
He can read the map.

00:40:34.117 --> 00:40:36.019
Easy for you to say,
you got nunchucks!

00:40:36.152 --> 00:40:39.356
I've been training four hours
a day for six months.

00:40:39.488 --> 00:40:41.257
Now look at me!

00:40:41.391 --> 00:40:43.860
Man, it is hot out here!

00:40:43.994 --> 00:40:48.732
How is this guy a character
in an adventure game?

00:40:48.865 --> 00:40:50.467
Okay, okay, okay.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.502
I gotta get this guy in shape
and build up some endurance.

00:40:53.636 --> 00:40:54.738
I know how to do that.

00:40:54.871 --> 00:40:56.473
Burpees.
Five burpees, right now.

00:40:56.639 --> 00:40:57.874
Get it going!

00:41:00.877 --> 00:41:02.712
- That's one.
- One!

00:41:08.551 --> 00:41:10.820
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah, come on!

00:41:13.123 --> 00:41:15.492
North is that way!

00:41:28.505 --> 00:41:29.839
You know, it's, uh...

00:41:29.973 --> 00:41:31.975
It's really good
to see you, Ed.

00:41:32.108 --> 00:41:33.510
I don't wanna hear it.

00:41:33.643 --> 00:41:35.845
You don't wanna hear
that it's good to see you?

00:41:35.979 --> 00:41:39.548
- You sold me out, Milo.
- I did not sell you out.

00:41:39.682 --> 00:41:41.751
We sold our business.
It was time.

00:41:41.885 --> 00:41:44.754
- Yeah, time for who?
- Well, it was time for me.

00:41:44.888 --> 00:41:46.689
Okay? Standing on my feet,

00:41:46.823 --> 00:41:49.192
serving a hundred plates
a night for 35 years?

00:41:49.325 --> 00:41:51.127
I was done.

00:41:51.261 --> 00:41:53.096
I was ready, man.

00:41:53.229 --> 00:41:54.931
I was ready to retire.

00:41:55.065 --> 00:41:56.299
I'm done talking!

00:42:11.414 --> 00:42:12.882
"The Oasis."

00:42:15.452 --> 00:42:17.287
I guess
that's the next level.

00:42:19.522 --> 00:42:20.723
Huh?

00:42:21.925 --> 00:42:24.027
The next level
of the game.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.395
We're in
a game?

00:42:25.528 --> 00:42:27.630
Oh. Yes, Grandpa Eddie,
we are in a game.

00:42:27.764 --> 00:42:29.032
You can't be
serious.

00:42:29.165 --> 00:42:30.533
Did you know
about this?

00:42:30.667 --> 00:42:32.602
I thought
you were done talking.

00:42:44.747 --> 00:42:46.649
- Bethany?
- Yep.

00:42:47.951 --> 00:42:50.286
- My name's Bethany too.
- Really?

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.522
Daddy, her name's Bethany too.

00:42:57.494 --> 00:42:59.462
Sure is, sweetie.

00:42:59.597 --> 00:43:01.698
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:06.604
Sure, yeah. Uh, come in.

00:43:07.837 --> 00:43:08.872
I'm sorry, I just...

00:43:09.005 --> 00:43:10.440
I didn't know
where else to go.

00:43:10.574 --> 00:43:12.275
No, no, no, it's okay.

00:43:12.408 --> 00:43:13.977
I'm glad you came.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:17.313
Do you think you can help me
get the machine to start?

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:22.285
That is so dangerous.

00:43:22.418 --> 00:43:23.520
I know.

00:43:25.488 --> 00:43:27.023
But I have to try.

00:43:29.325 --> 00:43:30.628
They're my team.

00:43:44.007 --> 00:43:46.276
So, what exactly
are we looking for again?

00:43:46.409 --> 00:43:48.278
We're looking
for my grandson, genius.

00:43:48.411 --> 00:43:51.681
Okay, "Follow the flame
to the desert fruit."

00:43:54.618 --> 00:43:55.718
Look.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.688
They're here.

00:43:58.821 --> 00:44:00.390
Hyenas.

00:44:00.523 --> 00:44:03.193
Unusual for
their bone-crushing teeth.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:08.998
Smoke Stack.

00:44:09.132 --> 00:44:10.767
Where's there's smoke...

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.002
There's fire.

00:44:13.136 --> 00:44:14.871
- Come on.
- Mm.

00:44:15.004 --> 00:44:17.540
- Boom!
- You call that a roll?

00:44:17.675 --> 00:44:18.942
Not bad at all.

00:44:19.075 --> 00:44:20.410
I'll bet you two more!

00:44:20.543 --> 00:44:23.179
Drinks! Drinks over here!

00:44:23.313 --> 00:44:24.347
Another round here!

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.049
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:44:46.402 --> 00:44:48.104
I thought
you'd never come back.

00:44:50.907 --> 00:44:52.542
I need to talk to you.

00:44:54.944 --> 00:44:56.279
Absolutely.

00:44:57.413 --> 00:44:59.916
Not here, not now.

00:45:00.049 --> 00:45:01.652
Not around them.

00:45:07.757 --> 00:45:09.092
Leave me alone!

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:14.964
Wow.

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.800
Fiery.

00:45:17.934 --> 00:45:19.902
Not a real person.

00:45:20.036 --> 00:45:22.105
- What'd she say?
- Well, she said she thought

00:45:22.238 --> 00:45:25.108
I was never gonna come back,
she wants to get together later,

00:45:25.241 --> 00:45:27.810
- and we all know what that means.
- Hiyo!

00:45:27.944 --> 00:45:29.912
It means that she's got
a clue for you.

00:45:30.046 --> 00:45:32.382
Oh, that's a coincidence.
I got a clue for her.

00:45:32.515 --> 00:45:34.117
- You got a clue for her.
- Wait.

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:37.153
She's your ex-girlfriend.
She's the flame.

00:45:37.287 --> 00:45:39.055
- "Follow the flame."
- What?

00:45:50.466 --> 00:45:52.335
The jewel, it's here.

00:46:08.451 --> 00:46:10.386
Is that the guy
that killed my parents?

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.955
No. Well, yeah. Kind of.

00:46:15.525 --> 00:46:17.795
We lost a good man today.

00:46:19.295 --> 00:46:20.631
The very best of us.

00:46:22.532 --> 00:46:24.500
For Dagfinn...

00:46:24.635 --> 00:46:26.836
wasn't just my hyena master.

00:46:28.171 --> 00:46:29.773
He was my friend.

00:46:29.906 --> 00:46:32.275
I loved him like a brother.

00:46:33.476 --> 00:46:36.512
And now he's gone.

00:46:36.647 --> 00:46:39.315
And his beloved hyenas
are left...

00:46:39.449 --> 00:46:40.983
without their master.

00:46:45.254 --> 00:46:46.623
Long live Dagfinn.

00:46:46.757 --> 00:46:49.626
Long live Dagfinn!

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.028
Why did he have to die?

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:56.734
He died because...

00:46:56.866 --> 00:46:58.968
he made a mistake.

00:46:59.102 --> 00:47:02.505
He tried to steal something
quite precious from me.

00:47:04.073 --> 00:47:06.342
He left me no choice.

00:47:06.476 --> 00:47:08.378
And now...

00:47:08.511 --> 00:47:12.548
I feed him
to his beloved hyenas.

00:47:16.519 --> 00:47:18.254
- That's messed up.
- Oh!

00:47:18.388 --> 00:47:20.456
I loved Dagfinn!

00:47:22.258 --> 00:47:24.595
There's none among you
I love as much.

00:47:25.863 --> 00:47:27.296
And so...

00:47:32.368 --> 00:47:33.936
The key!

00:47:35.004 --> 00:47:36.774
It's gone.

00:47:37.841 --> 00:47:40.009
Thief!

00:47:40.143 --> 00:47:42.679
I got her. I got the thief.

00:47:42.813 --> 00:47:44.447
Wait.

00:47:44.581 --> 00:47:46.916
- Are you guys...? Wha...?
- Come here.

00:47:47.049 --> 00:47:49.553
- Catch her!
- Don't let her get away.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:55.358
Trying to steal
the key to my chest?

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:58.428
Nope.

00:47:58.562 --> 00:47:59.596
Shake her down.

00:48:02.599 --> 00:48:04.300
I'm sorry, I did it.
It was my fault.

00:48:04.434 --> 00:48:05.968
I, uh...

00:48:07.403 --> 00:48:09.972
I just... I don't...

00:48:10.106 --> 00:48:13.142
I don't know what I was...
Oy vey.

00:48:13.276 --> 00:48:17.681
Uh, it's like, um...
It's like I'm hyperventilating.

00:48:17.815 --> 00:48:20.016
Does anyone have,
like, a eucalyptus inhaler?

00:48:20.149 --> 00:48:21.852
Or a brown paper bag?

00:48:21.984 --> 00:48:22.920
Spencer?

00:48:23.052 --> 00:48:24.420
Is it really hot in here?

00:48:24.555 --> 00:48:25.988
You mean...?

00:48:26.122 --> 00:48:28.491
- That's him. Right there.
- What?

00:48:28.625 --> 00:48:31.662
That ain't Spencer.
Look, I know my grandson.

00:48:31.795 --> 00:48:32.896
My grandson's a guy.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:35.933
Did he change his hair?

00:48:37.099 --> 00:48:39.068
- Cut off her head.
- Yeah!

00:48:39.202 --> 00:48:41.137
- Cut off her head!
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:44.507
I just think, uh, maybe
don't cut off my head?

00:48:44.641 --> 00:48:45.508
- Oh!
- Spencer!

00:48:45.642 --> 00:48:46.944
- Oh, my.
- Did he just...?

00:48:47.076 --> 00:48:48.010
Oh, Lord.

00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:51.314
That's my Life Alert.

00:48:51.447 --> 00:48:52.916
I gotta take my pill.

00:48:59.723 --> 00:49:01.023
Come on!

00:49:02.893 --> 00:49:03.861
Spencer!

00:49:03.993 --> 00:49:05.729
Oh, my God, you're alive.

00:49:05.863 --> 00:49:07.731
What are you guys doing here?

00:49:07.865 --> 00:49:10.567
What are we doing here?
We came to get you, fool!

00:49:10.701 --> 00:49:13.704
- Bethany?
- Not Bethany. Fridge, goddamn it!

00:49:13.837 --> 00:49:15.404
What? So, um...

00:49:15.538 --> 00:49:17.875
Milo Walker, darling.

00:49:19.943 --> 00:49:21.377
Milo?

00:49:23.614 --> 00:49:26.182
- Spencer? Is that you, kiddo?
- Grandpa?

00:49:26.315 --> 00:49:28.585
Guys, I found Spencer.
Here's Spencer right here.

00:49:28.719 --> 00:49:31.053
What are you stealing for?

00:49:31.187 --> 00:49:33.824
- I'm still me.
- Oh.

00:49:33.957 --> 00:49:34.892
Hey.

00:49:35.024 --> 00:49:37.728
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:49:42.265 --> 00:49:43.232
Come on.

00:49:47.537 --> 00:49:49.205
Let's go.

00:49:58.949 --> 00:50:01.718
Damn it, I was so close.
I had the key in my hand.

00:50:01.852 --> 00:50:04.053
- Why'd you stop me?
- Huh? Someone yelled "thief,"

00:50:04.186 --> 00:50:05.822
so I grabbed you.
What do you want?

00:50:05.956 --> 00:50:08.291
You shouldn't have come.
I had it under control.

00:50:08.424 --> 00:50:10.861
Did you? It looked like
you just got murdered.

00:50:10.994 --> 00:50:13.630
I mean, what the hell, Spencer?
Why are you even here?

00:50:13.764 --> 00:50:15.231
Why did you have the game?

00:50:15.364 --> 00:50:18.702
We destroyed it
so that this would never happen!

00:50:18.835 --> 00:50:20.571
I went back and got it, okay?

00:50:20.704 --> 00:50:23.907
I don't know
why I did it, but I did.

00:50:24.041 --> 00:50:26.710
And then last night...

00:50:26.843 --> 00:50:28.411
I've been in kind
of a weird place,

00:50:28.544 --> 00:50:30.379
and something
came over me, okay?

00:50:30.513 --> 00:50:32.716
And now we're all
stuck here again!

00:50:32.849 --> 00:50:37.520
I thought that I would be him.
Bravestone!

00:50:37.654 --> 00:50:39.756
I wanted to feel
like that again.

00:50:41.825 --> 00:50:44.728
Like... I could do anything.

00:50:47.196 --> 00:50:49.633
But instead, I'm, um...

00:50:49.766 --> 00:50:51.602
Ming Fleetfoot.

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:56.138
"Cat burglar,
pickpocket, safecracker."

00:50:56.272 --> 00:50:57.941
Another better character.

00:50:58.075 --> 00:51:00.309
- "Weakness: pollen."
- Yeah.

00:51:00.443 --> 00:51:02.646
She's small and crafty
and has allergies.

00:51:02.779 --> 00:51:03.880
She's basically me.

00:51:05.082 --> 00:51:07.050
I swear, man, if we survive,

00:51:07.183 --> 00:51:09.352
I am gonna kill you.

00:51:09.485 --> 00:51:12.188
I just can't believe
you came back here on purpose.

00:51:12.321 --> 00:51:14.256
I'm sorry. Okay?

00:51:16.492 --> 00:51:18.028
I'm sorry.

00:51:19.328 --> 00:51:20.529
Wait!

00:51:20.664 --> 00:51:22.099
Oh, there she is.

00:51:22.231 --> 00:51:24.601
- Who?
- My ex.

00:51:24.735 --> 00:51:26.202
Okay.

00:51:26.335 --> 00:51:27.604
Hi.

00:51:29.006 --> 00:51:31.842
If my husband knew
I was talking to you,

00:51:31.975 --> 00:51:34.111
you'd be dead by morning.

00:51:34.243 --> 00:51:36.813
Uh, don't tell him?

00:51:36.947 --> 00:51:39.281
Listen to me,
Jurgen and his army

00:51:39.415 --> 00:51:41.283
are returning to his fortress.

00:51:41.417 --> 00:51:44.621
There, they will meet
the Brothers Kababik.

00:51:44.755 --> 00:51:48.190
He will trade the Falcon Jewel,
and an alliance will be formed.

00:51:48.324 --> 00:51:51.828
You must get the jewel
before that happens.

00:51:51.962 --> 00:51:53.429
You're our only hope,

00:51:53.563 --> 00:51:55.599
so you must hurry.

00:51:57.668 --> 00:51:58.835
Oh, my.

00:52:01.672 --> 00:52:03.272
- Now you must go.
- Gotta go.

00:52:03.406 --> 00:52:04.808
They're gonna meet
the Brothers who?

00:52:04.941 --> 00:52:06.308
The Brothers Kababik.

00:52:06.442 --> 00:52:08.377
- The Brothers Bababik.
- Shh!

00:52:08.511 --> 00:52:10.814
- Kababik?
- You must get the jewel

00:52:10.947 --> 00:52:12.214
before that happens.

00:52:12.348 --> 00:52:15.752
You are our only hope,
so you must hurry.

00:52:23.627 --> 00:52:26.096
I think you should explain it
to us one more time.

00:52:26.228 --> 00:52:27.764
- Wait a second.
- Oh!

00:52:27.898 --> 00:52:29.231
What about the desert fruit?

00:52:29.365 --> 00:52:30.567
Aren't you gonna
lead us to that?

00:52:30.701 --> 00:52:32.569
Now I must go...

00:52:32.703 --> 00:52:34.871
before Switchblade
realizes I'm gone.

00:52:36.573 --> 00:52:38.642
What? Switchblade?

00:52:38.775 --> 00:52:39.743
That's his weakness.

00:52:41.243 --> 00:52:43.714
I love you, Dr. Bravestone.

00:52:44.981 --> 00:52:47.084
And I always will.

00:52:47.216 --> 00:52:49.019
That...

00:52:49.152 --> 00:52:51.220
is my curse.

00:52:54.791 --> 00:52:56.159
I love you too!

00:52:57.894 --> 00:53:00.030
Well, she seems
like a nice girl.

00:53:04.701 --> 00:53:06.737
We need camels.

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:10.272
Okay, if we're gonna catch up
with Jurgen, we need camels.

00:53:10.406 --> 00:53:13.610
And we need to find the desert
fruit, whatever that is.

00:53:13.744 --> 00:53:16.213
"Follow the flame."
I guess we have to follow her.

00:53:16.345 --> 00:53:18.882
You guys follow her,
we'll go steal some camels.

00:53:38.702 --> 00:53:39.936
Whoa.

00:54:06.563 --> 00:54:08.330
"Jumanji Berry Tree."

00:54:08.464 --> 00:54:10.332
Jumanji berry?

00:54:10.466 --> 00:54:12.903
That's a desert fruit?

00:54:13.036 --> 00:54:15.105
I guess.

00:54:15.238 --> 00:54:19.209
"In the moment of need,
remember the seed."

00:54:19.341 --> 00:54:21.278
A little bit
of Jumanji wisdom there.

00:54:26.917 --> 00:54:28.051
There it is.

00:54:32.923 --> 00:54:35.125
Milo and I will break in
and get the camels.

00:54:35.258 --> 00:54:37.961
Grandpa, you stay here on
lookout. Keep a low profile.

00:54:38.094 --> 00:54:40.362
Got it? Low profile.

00:54:40.496 --> 00:54:42.331
If anyone tries
to enter the livery,

00:54:42.464 --> 00:54:45.001
just, I don't know,
whistle or something.

00:54:45.135 --> 00:54:46.502
Sure thing.

00:54:50.807 --> 00:54:52.242
That's not when you smolder.

00:54:52.374 --> 00:54:54.811
It's not the moment for it.
Forget it.

00:54:54.945 --> 00:54:56.512
I did it.
I don't know what it was.

00:54:56.646 --> 00:54:58.782
Look like your stomach
is upset.

00:54:58.915 --> 00:55:00.549
Like you ate something bad.

00:55:03.153 --> 00:55:04.520
Oh, man.

00:55:04.654 --> 00:55:07.157
I'm sweating. I'm sweating.

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:08.992
Stealing makes me
very uncomfortable,

00:55:09.125 --> 00:55:12.329
which is not ideal
for a burglar.

00:55:34.383 --> 00:55:36.753
So the fruit
is in the tree.

00:55:36.887 --> 00:55:38.088
But you can't get to it

00:55:38.221 --> 00:55:39.689
without going through
the water

00:55:39.823 --> 00:55:41.291
or whatever that is.

00:55:41.423 --> 00:55:44.261
Get boiled or eaten by piranhas
or something.

00:55:48.098 --> 00:55:49.531
"Follow the flame."

00:55:51.034 --> 00:55:53.270
I think that's how we get there.

00:55:53.402 --> 00:55:56.538
But I don't know how
I'm supposed to make that jump.

00:55:56.673 --> 00:55:59.109
I mean, it's doable...

00:55:59.242 --> 00:56:01.611
but I don't have
my usual explosiveness.

00:56:02.679 --> 00:56:05.514
- Ugh!
- Wh... Ho! Yo!

00:56:05.649 --> 00:56:07.851
Ho, ho, ho! Wow!

00:56:16.826 --> 00:56:17.727
Yes!

00:56:21.197 --> 00:56:23.465
Martha! Ho!

00:56:26.535 --> 00:56:28.405
Martha!

00:56:28.537 --> 00:56:29.739
Oh...

00:56:33.542 --> 00:56:36.079
- Martha!
- Oh, it's really heavy.

00:56:37.414 --> 00:56:40.150
Ugh! You okay?
Give me your hand.

00:56:40.283 --> 00:56:41.450
There you go.

00:56:49.559 --> 00:56:51.493
Ow. Oh...

00:56:54.564 --> 00:56:56.166
Wait a second.

00:56:56.299 --> 00:56:58.335
- What...?
- The hell, man?

00:56:58.467 --> 00:57:00.303
Oh, my God!

00:57:00.437 --> 00:57:02.439
- The hell, man?
- Oh, my God.

00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:07.177
- Fridge?
- Yeah.

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:09.079
Martha?

00:57:09.212 --> 00:57:10.512
Yeah.

00:57:16.619 --> 00:57:19.656
Hey, move along.
Nothing to see here.

00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:20.857
What'd you say?

00:57:20.991 --> 00:57:22.491
I said, keep walking, pal.

00:57:22.625 --> 00:57:25.195
Nothing to see here. Beat it.

00:57:25.328 --> 00:57:29.466
- What'd you say?
- Beat it, get out of here.

00:57:29.599 --> 00:57:30.867
What'd you say?

00:57:41.845 --> 00:57:42.979
I said, scram!

00:57:50.954 --> 00:57:55.025
You want a piece of me?
Yeah, come on, come on.

00:57:55.158 --> 00:57:57.460
What do you got?
What do you got? Come on!

00:57:58.695 --> 00:58:00.830
Come and get it. Yeah!

00:58:04.334 --> 00:58:06.302
Come on, you bastards!

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:10.140
Ha, wow! Ha, ha!

00:58:10.273 --> 00:58:12.075
Here, camel, camel.

00:58:13.209 --> 00:58:14.577
Come on, let's go.

00:58:16.312 --> 00:58:19.349
They are proud and majestic
animals, aren't they?

00:58:23.453 --> 00:58:25.755
Oh, you're welcome. Heh.

00:58:27.857 --> 00:58:31.861
Did you...? Were you
just talking to them?

00:58:31.995 --> 00:58:34.631
Um, press your menu.
Uh, it's right here.

00:58:37.333 --> 00:58:38.701
"Linguistics."

00:58:38.835 --> 00:58:40.470
You can talk to animals.

00:58:40.603 --> 00:58:41.604
Yes.

00:58:41.738 --> 00:58:44.140
It appears that I speak camel.

00:58:44.274 --> 00:58:45.909
Can you ask them to
come with us and...?

00:58:47.343 --> 00:58:48.645
Excuse me.

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.881
They're willing to talk.

00:58:52.015 --> 00:58:53.917
Uh, they wanna know
what's in it for them

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:56.386
and how much luggage we have.

00:58:56.519 --> 00:58:59.923
Will you look at me? Oh!

00:59:00.056 --> 00:59:02.560
I mean, what am I supposed
to do with this?

00:59:02.692 --> 00:59:04.127
You read the map.

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.629
I don't wanna read the map.
I'm supposed to be her.

00:59:06.763 --> 00:59:09.699
Instead, there's actual hair
growing out of my face!

00:59:09.833 --> 00:59:14.137
Sorry. All bodies are beautiful,
even this one.

00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:15.872
Wait a second.

00:59:21.177 --> 00:59:25.148
- Oh, this is amazing!
- Careful.

00:59:25.281 --> 00:59:26.449
Fridge...

00:59:29.252 --> 00:59:32.188
Yo, this thing is insane!

00:59:32.322 --> 00:59:34.023
Be careful.
That body is not a toy.

00:59:34.157 --> 00:59:35.758
No, it's a machine.

00:59:35.892 --> 00:59:38.294
And on top of that...

00:59:38.428 --> 00:59:39.963
boobs.

00:59:40.096 --> 00:59:41.965
Touch my boobs,
and I will murder you.

00:59:42.098 --> 00:59:44.434
Too late. It was literally
the first thing I did.

00:59:44.568 --> 00:59:45.835
Ew!

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:50.273
Hey, hey, don't do that.

00:59:50.406 --> 00:59:52.175
Let's take this berry
and go meet them.

00:59:52.308 --> 00:59:53.843
Relax, girl.

00:59:53.977 --> 00:59:56.112
I'm trying that flying
acrobat thing you did.

00:59:56.246 --> 00:59:57.814
- Don't. We have the berry.
- Check this out.

00:59:57.947 --> 00:59:59.482
- It's not necessary.
- Omaha, Omaha!

00:59:59.617 --> 01:00:01.184
- Hut, hut, hike!
- Wait.

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:06.689
Fridge, be careful! I am telling
you, that body's a weapon.

01:00:06.823 --> 01:00:08.191
You don't know
what it's capable of.

01:00:08.324 --> 01:00:09.359
This is amazing!

01:00:09.492 --> 01:00:11.194
That body's a loaded gun!

01:00:11.327 --> 01:00:14.330
Yeah! And this gun's
about to go off!

01:00:14.464 --> 01:00:16.199
Whoo... Oh!

01:00:16.332 --> 01:00:18.101
Oh, my God!

01:00:18.234 --> 01:00:19.869
Fridge!

01:00:20.003 --> 01:00:21.371
- Come here.
- Ugh!

01:00:21.504 --> 01:00:24.207
Oh, my God.
Goddamn it!

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.610
- Here, I got you. I got ya.
- Ugh!

01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:41.057
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no!

01:00:41.191 --> 01:00:43.259
Oh, my God, that was awful.

01:00:43.393 --> 01:00:45.328
I hate being the map guy!

01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:49.999
Let's get out of here.

01:00:55.872 --> 01:00:58.007
Switchblade! There he is.

01:00:59.442 --> 01:01:00.743
Bravestone!

01:01:00.877 --> 01:01:03.246
I told you to stay
the hell away from my wife!

01:01:07.283 --> 01:01:10.554
- We got company.
- What did you do?

01:01:10.688 --> 01:01:13.223
All right, guys, this is
the moment. We need you now.

01:01:16.726 --> 01:01:20.897
Uh, they said that we can
get away out the back door.

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:23.833
- Are you talking to that camel?
- Yes.

01:01:23.967 --> 01:01:25.703
That's Lucille and Hank.

01:01:25.835 --> 01:01:27.503
And Jeffrey's in the back.

01:01:35.211 --> 01:01:36.813
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:01:39.382 --> 01:01:41.150
- We should get going.
- What happened?

01:01:41.284 --> 01:01:42.952
My grandpa beat up
45 strangers.

01:01:43.086 --> 01:01:45.088
That woman's husband
is trying to kill him.

01:01:45.221 --> 01:01:46.557
Mm.

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:48.091
Is that the desert fruit?

01:01:48.224 --> 01:01:49.727
Yeah. It's a Jumanji berry,

01:01:49.859 --> 01:01:52.061
and it weighs like 100 pounds.

01:01:52.195 --> 01:01:53.296
My grandpa will carry it.

01:01:56.634 --> 01:01:57.834
We should get out of here.

01:01:57.967 --> 01:01:59.802
Come on, Grandpa.
Let's go.

01:01:59.936 --> 01:02:01.639
- I could take them.
- What?

01:02:01.771 --> 01:02:02.972
What? We escaped.

01:02:03.106 --> 01:02:05.408
- I said, I could take them.
- Oh, Eddie.

01:02:05.541 --> 01:02:07.543
No, Grandpa Eddie,
that's Switchblade!

01:02:07.678 --> 01:02:09.747
I'm telling you,
there's a time when you run.

01:02:09.879 --> 01:02:12.148
Then there's a time in life,
like now, where you stay...

01:02:17.954 --> 01:02:20.591
Yeah! Yeah!

01:02:20.724 --> 01:02:21.991
Switchblade! Switchblade!

01:02:22.125 --> 01:02:23.793
Nice shot, Switchblade!

01:02:32.068 --> 01:02:33.136
- Oh!
- Phew.

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:41.844
What?

01:02:55.024 --> 01:02:57.561
We should see
Mount Zhatmire pretty soon.

01:02:59.996 --> 01:03:03.833
You know, Gladys and I took
a road trip before she passed.

01:03:03.966 --> 01:03:06.302
We went on a ceramics tour

01:03:06.436 --> 01:03:07.937
through the Southwest.

01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:10.540
I lost my restaurant
so you could drive around

01:03:10.674 --> 01:03:12.776
- and look at ashtrays?
- Yes, Ed.

01:03:12.942 --> 01:03:15.311
That's what you do
when you retire.

01:03:15.445 --> 01:03:17.681
You explore your interests.

01:03:17.815 --> 01:03:19.449
I don't have interests.

01:03:19.583 --> 01:03:22.218
Guys like me, we don't retire!

01:03:22.352 --> 01:03:24.354
We work,
and then we keep working,

01:03:24.487 --> 01:03:26.189
and then, eventually, we die.

01:03:26.322 --> 01:03:29.192
But you retired me.
You retired me.

01:03:29.325 --> 01:03:31.729
It's a wonder I lasted
as long as I did.

01:03:31.861 --> 01:03:33.963
- What?
- You're a difficult man, Ed.

01:03:34.097 --> 01:03:36.199
You don't abandon
your best friend, Milo.

01:03:36.332 --> 01:03:39.770
When I lost the restaurant,
I lost everything!

01:03:39.902 --> 01:03:40.937
You...?

01:03:42.138 --> 01:03:44.006
Yes. Yes, I know he is.

01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:47.243
- Are you talking to my camel?
- Yes, I'm talking to the camel.

01:03:47.377 --> 01:03:50.848
And he can tell
that you're a pain in the ass.

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:53.282
My camel's taking your side?

01:03:54.818 --> 01:03:56.854
And he's not your camel.

01:03:56.986 --> 01:03:58.921
He's just giving you a ride.

01:03:59.055 --> 01:04:03.025
Oh! Well, how about the both
of you go screw yourselves?

01:04:03.159 --> 01:04:05.228
- What did you just say?
- Guys!

01:04:05.361 --> 01:04:08.665
You and me, we gonna settle
this right here, right now!

01:04:10.233 --> 01:04:11.901
- I'll show you.
- What are you doing?

01:04:12.034 --> 01:04:14.937
- Don't worry about it.
- Milo, what are you doing?

01:04:15.071 --> 01:04:17.674
Hold on. Wait, wait.
Here we go.

01:04:21.879 --> 01:04:25.348
You want a piece of me, huh?
That's what you want?

01:04:25.481 --> 01:04:28.017
You do not want a piece of him,
Milo, I'm telling you.

01:04:28.151 --> 01:04:30.520
Oh, that's where
you're wrong, young man.

01:04:30.654 --> 01:04:32.689
'Cause I do want a piece.

01:04:32.823 --> 01:04:34.892
I want a big piece.

01:04:35.024 --> 01:04:40.062
See, Eddie, what you don't know
is that for the last 15 years,

01:04:40.196 --> 01:04:42.498
I've been studying tai chi.

01:04:42.633 --> 01:04:44.000
And right now,

01:04:44.133 --> 01:04:46.402
I am harnessing my chi.

01:04:46.536 --> 01:04:49.606
And when I'm done,
I'm gonna whup your ass.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.743
Milo, I am telling you,
this is not a good idea.

01:04:57.046 --> 01:04:58.481
No!

01:05:04.454 --> 01:05:06.989
Oh, dude!

01:05:07.123 --> 01:05:09.292
You gotta stop
killing everybody.

01:05:17.366 --> 01:05:18.936
All right, then.

01:05:19.068 --> 01:05:21.805
Well, I guess that's settled.

01:05:34.383 --> 01:05:36.252
The camels just stopped.

01:05:40.089 --> 01:05:42.124
This is as far as they go.

01:05:42.258 --> 01:05:44.561
To get to Jurgen's fortress,
they said that we can

01:05:44.695 --> 01:05:47.163
head down this path here
and make a right.

01:05:47.296 --> 01:05:48.799
Then we're in his territory.

01:05:48.932 --> 01:05:50.299
And they don't wanna
go there

01:05:50.433 --> 01:05:53.369
because they
don't want to die.

01:05:53.503 --> 01:05:55.572
We don't wanna die either.

01:06:00.443 --> 01:06:02.913
He's the worst Bravestone
of all time.

01:06:37.681 --> 01:06:40.349
So we have to get
across... this.

01:06:43.921 --> 01:06:46.623
Okay, we can do this.
We can do this.

01:06:46.757 --> 01:06:49.091
We have to take our time,
make careful decisions.

01:06:49.225 --> 01:06:51.093
What are you talking about?
It's obvious.

01:06:51.227 --> 01:06:52.596
We start on that bridge there,

01:06:52.729 --> 01:06:54.932
then jump to that one
that heads to the right,

01:06:55.064 --> 01:06:57.568
and then those look
like two sides of a trapezoid...

01:06:58.936 --> 01:07:02.371
Geometry.
That's what it's for!

01:07:02.505 --> 01:07:04.708
Maybe this character's
not totally worthless.

01:07:06.043 --> 01:07:07.811
- I'll go first.
- Really?

01:07:12.916 --> 01:07:14.685
You see? It's no big deal.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:17.888
Oh.
What's going on?

01:07:18.021 --> 01:07:19.923
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, no.

01:07:22.559 --> 01:07:23.760
- No.
- Grandpa!

01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:28.865
Ah, crap.

01:07:30.266 --> 01:07:31.400
Ah, geez.

01:07:33.036 --> 01:07:34.537
What the hell?

01:07:37.941 --> 01:07:39.977
- It's okay. We can do this.
- Yeah?

01:07:40.142 --> 01:07:41.812
It's about finding
the right timing.

01:07:41.945 --> 01:07:43.714
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Follow me.

01:07:48.885 --> 01:07:50.621
Come on!

01:07:50.754 --> 01:07:52.455
Come on, Milo, come on!

01:07:54.591 --> 01:07:57.694
Ah! Whoa! Whoa!

01:07:57.828 --> 01:07:59.863
- Oh! Oh, Lord.
- Here.

01:07:59.997 --> 01:08:01.497
Oh, okay.

01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:08.504
Hey, you guys.

01:08:08.639 --> 01:08:10.674
Is that rock... moving?

01:08:16.079 --> 01:08:18.247
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:08:18.381 --> 01:08:20.584
Well, now, this is a problem.

01:08:20.717 --> 01:08:22.853
- Come on, what is it?
- Oh, my.

01:08:22.986 --> 01:08:25.022
- Spit it out!
- What is it?

01:08:25.154 --> 01:08:28.157
- Tell us!
- Tell us! Milo!

01:08:32.596 --> 01:08:34.263
Those are mandrills.

01:08:34.397 --> 01:08:36.532
- We should go. Go, go!
- Go!

01:08:40.637 --> 01:08:42.673
That one! Obtuse angle!

01:08:44.775 --> 01:08:46.843
Note the distinctive
and colorful pigment

01:08:46.977 --> 01:08:48.979
around their face and buttocks.

01:08:52.716 --> 01:08:55.384
Mandrills are the heaviest
of all monkeys.

01:08:55.518 --> 01:08:59.890
Even heavier than baboons, with
which they are often confused.

01:09:02.559 --> 01:09:04.360
And now head for the rhombus!

01:09:04.493 --> 01:09:06.429
Come on. Hurry up.

01:09:06.563 --> 01:09:07.831
- Rhombus! Rhombus!
- Come on.

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.675
No, Martha!

01:09:18.809 --> 01:09:20.811
- You're on the wrong bridge!
- What?

01:09:20.944 --> 01:09:22.378
The perpendicular one!

01:09:29.653 --> 01:09:30.821
Martha!

01:09:37.194 --> 01:09:38.161
Martha!

01:09:41.363 --> 01:09:43.100
No!

01:09:43.232 --> 01:09:46.203
No!

01:09:46.335 --> 01:09:48.705
Spencer, behind you!

01:09:51.041 --> 01:09:52.709
Jump!

01:09:52.843 --> 01:09:55.145
Come on, I got you!

01:09:56.613 --> 01:09:58.782
Spencer!

01:10:06.455 --> 01:10:07.791
Oh, no! Ow! Ow!

01:10:18.034 --> 01:10:20.336
Oh, no! No! Ow! Ow!

01:10:20.469 --> 01:10:21.504
Get off!

01:10:28.277 --> 01:10:30.046
Come on.

01:10:35.051 --> 01:10:36.787
All right, bring it on.

01:10:38.955 --> 01:10:41.892
Come on, come here. Ha, ha!

01:10:43.927 --> 01:10:45.394
- Grandpa!
- Ow!

01:10:45.528 --> 01:10:47.564
Grandpa! Enough!

01:10:47.697 --> 01:10:49.099
- Grandpa, stop!
- Yeah!

01:10:49.232 --> 01:10:50.100
They're gone!

01:10:52.535 --> 01:10:54.104
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

01:11:01.678 --> 01:11:03.046
Come on!

01:11:08.952 --> 01:11:10.120
Give me your hand!

01:11:10.253 --> 01:11:11.655
- What?
- Trust me!

01:11:32.809 --> 01:11:34.211
Oh! Go.

01:11:35.846 --> 01:11:38.682
Last one. Aim for
the center of the parabola!

01:11:41.785 --> 01:11:44.955
Oh, damn. Ugh! Son of a...

01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:48.325
Ow!

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:53.296
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:11:53.429 --> 01:11:55.565
- Eddie?
- Milo!

01:11:55.699 --> 01:11:58.268
Eddie!
Hey, Eddie, where you going?

01:11:59.401 --> 01:12:00.904
I need your help, Eddie.

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:04.506
Eddie!

01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:07.677
Oh!

01:12:10.313 --> 01:12:14.718
- Oh!
- Ugh.

01:12:17.254 --> 01:12:19.289
Eddie! Milo!

01:12:26.663 --> 01:12:28.031
Oh!

01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:42.746
- Seriously?
- Later.

01:12:44.147 --> 01:12:45.514
- Run!
- Run!

01:13:03.532 --> 01:13:04.768
Hyah!

01:13:19.616 --> 01:13:21.284
Hey, guys.

01:13:21.418 --> 01:13:22.652
Who the hell's this?

01:13:22.786 --> 01:13:25.088
Alex, what are you doing here?

01:13:25.221 --> 01:13:27.290
Bethany thought
you might need some help.

01:13:27.424 --> 01:13:29.893
- Where is Bethany?
- She's right here.

01:13:30.927 --> 01:13:32.062
You mean...?

01:13:38.301 --> 01:13:40.502
"Oh, my God, right?

01:13:40.637 --> 01:13:42.973
Like, I'm a total horse.

01:13:43.106 --> 01:13:45.942
I can't believe
that we found you guys.

01:13:46.076 --> 01:13:47.777
Hi."

01:13:47.911 --> 01:13:50.747
Yep, that's Bethany.
Ha-ha-ha. What's up, girl?

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.948
Hey.

01:13:52.082 --> 01:13:53.917
Oh, we brought you
some clothes.

01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:55.318
You must be freezing.

01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:04.194
So, uh, this horse
is a character in the game?

01:14:04.327 --> 01:14:06.229
Yeah. Cyclone's his name.

01:14:08.798 --> 01:14:10.333
- How's that feel?
- I don't know.

01:14:10.467 --> 01:14:12.335
I sprained it pretty good.

01:14:12.469 --> 01:14:13.870
Where'd you get these clothes?

01:14:14.004 --> 01:14:16.072
When I realized how far
north we were going,

01:14:16.206 --> 01:14:17.841
- we stopped to go shopping.
- Ah.

01:14:17.974 --> 01:14:20.010
You can shop here?
How did you know that?

01:14:20.143 --> 01:14:22.345
I was here for 20 years, kiddo.

01:14:22.479 --> 01:14:24.414
At least I got rid
of that stupid hat.

01:14:24.546 --> 01:14:26.316
Now I got this stupid hat.

01:14:42.599 --> 01:14:44.200
It's something,
isn't it?

01:14:45.668 --> 01:14:47.303
Yeah,
it's something.

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:52.375
You know, Eddie...

01:14:52.509 --> 01:14:57.213
you didn't lose everything
when you lost the restaurant.

01:14:57.347 --> 01:14:59.149
You still got a lot, man.

01:15:03.853 --> 01:15:05.121
I lost my friend.

01:15:08.224 --> 01:15:09.459
So did I.

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:24.908
I'm sorry, Milo.

01:15:32.115 --> 01:15:34.951
Hey, I'm sorry too, Eddie.

01:15:35.085 --> 01:15:37.555
I should have tracked you down
a long time ago.

01:15:39.823 --> 01:15:42.358
I'm glad you came over
for coffee.

01:15:45.728 --> 01:15:47.597
What made you do it, huh?

01:15:49.365 --> 01:15:50.934
I mean, why now?

01:15:54.104 --> 01:15:55.405
Milo, what's going on?

01:16:01.444 --> 01:16:02.580
You're sick.

01:16:06.916 --> 01:16:07.917
How bad?

01:16:09.819 --> 01:16:11.754
I don't have much time left.

01:16:14.924 --> 01:16:17.127
Son of a bitch.

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.829
But I count myself lucky,
Eddie.

01:16:19.963 --> 01:16:22.932
I was married
to a wonderful woman.

01:16:23.066 --> 01:16:25.768
I got to live a wonderful life.

01:16:25.902 --> 01:16:28.438
And not everybody
can say that.

01:16:28.572 --> 01:16:31.808
That's why I wanted
to make things better with you.

01:16:31.941 --> 01:16:34.277
And now that they are...

01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:36.446
well, I'm...

01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.248
I'm happy about that too.

01:16:52.262 --> 01:16:55.798
Grandpa, Milo.
Come on, we gotta go.

01:17:02.906 --> 01:17:04.274
"The Fortress."

01:17:04.407 --> 01:17:06.509
Looks like
the last level.

01:17:06.644 --> 01:17:08.978
Okay, so we, uh,
climb that mountain

01:17:09.112 --> 01:17:10.413
and then we sneak in somehow.

01:17:10.547 --> 01:17:12.048
Yeah,
and then we steal the jewel

01:17:12.182 --> 01:17:13.917
before the Brothers Kababik
get there.

01:17:14.050 --> 01:17:16.753
- And then show it to the sun?
- Sounds like a plan.

01:17:16.886 --> 01:17:18.488
What?

01:17:18.622 --> 01:17:21.925
I'm sorry, I think I missed
the "plan" part of the plan.

01:17:22.058 --> 01:17:25.261
That last level almost killed
us all. I can barely walk.

01:17:25.395 --> 01:17:27.665
Your grandpa beats the hell
out of the wrong guy

01:17:27.797 --> 01:17:30.668
or we get attacked by a bear,
what am I supposed to do?

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.268
I'm not gonna beat up
the wrong guy.

01:17:32.402 --> 01:17:34.070
You are gonna beat up
the wrong guy!

01:17:34.204 --> 01:17:35.872
You're not a good Bravestone!

01:17:36.005 --> 01:17:37.575
You're too stubborn
and pissed off.

01:17:37.707 --> 01:17:39.075
You keep getting us killed.

01:17:39.209 --> 01:17:40.777
What the hell
you talking about?

01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:42.412
And Milo...

01:17:42.545 --> 01:17:44.514
And I say this
with all due respect, sir.

01:17:44.648 --> 01:17:46.916
...is not a good person
to be the zoologist.

01:17:47.050 --> 01:17:49.118
He talks too slow,
and by the time

01:17:49.252 --> 01:17:50.887
he gets to the point,
you're dead!

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.355
Once again, no offense.

01:17:52.488 --> 01:17:53.356
None taken.

01:17:53.489 --> 01:17:55.058
And let me tell you why.

01:17:55.191 --> 01:17:57.927
- Because my friend Bernard...
- You see?

01:17:58.061 --> 01:18:00.129
You're a thief who's
too neurotic to steal,

01:18:00.263 --> 01:18:01.931
Bethany's a horse...

01:18:03.667 --> 01:18:05.935
All I know is,
we are stuck here again,

01:18:06.069 --> 01:18:10.173
we are running out of lives,
and my ankle is killing me! Ahh!

01:18:10.306 --> 01:18:12.175
- Oh, my God!
- Fridge!

01:18:12.308 --> 01:18:14.544
Fridge! Are you okay?

01:18:15.845 --> 01:18:18.214
Yo, you guys gotta see this!

01:18:31.427 --> 01:18:34.364
That's what the water
looked like at the tree.

01:18:34.497 --> 01:18:35.765
When we...

01:18:35.898 --> 01:18:37.867
Switched bodies.

01:19:19.509 --> 01:19:21.712
- Goddamn, that is cold!
- Oh!

01:19:21.844 --> 01:19:25.783
Oh! Oh, man! It's freezing!

01:19:25.915 --> 01:19:27.050
What the hell, man?

01:19:28.985 --> 01:19:30.353
Yes!

01:19:30.486 --> 01:19:31.722
I missed you so much.

01:19:31.854 --> 01:19:33.724
Oh, my God, you guys, hi.

01:19:33.856 --> 01:19:36.560
Ahem, Spencer?

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.996
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:43.866 --> 01:19:46.169
- Grandpa?
- Yeah, what?

01:19:48.605 --> 01:19:49.472
Milo?

01:19:52.442 --> 01:19:53.910
You should see
the size of your...

01:19:54.043 --> 01:19:57.180
Phew. Damn.

01:19:57.313 --> 01:19:59.349
I never thought I'd be
this happy to shrink.

01:20:00.516 --> 01:20:01.719
I have never seen anything

01:20:01.851 --> 01:20:02.919
quite like that before.

01:20:03.052 --> 01:20:04.387
Oh, my God, it's so good

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.724
to be able to talk again
with words.

01:20:06.856 --> 01:20:09.525
- Spencer, hi!
- Hey, Bethany.

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:11.194
We have so much
catching up to do.

01:20:11.327 --> 01:20:12.696
I wanna hear about New York.

01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:15.799
But it feels like this
isn't the perfect moment.

01:20:15.932 --> 01:20:17.967
Right. Like, later.

01:20:18.101 --> 01:20:19.235
Later.

01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:23.674
- Better?
- Yeah.

01:20:23.807 --> 01:20:25.341
Much.

01:20:29.479 --> 01:20:31.648
I got hair! Heh, heh!

01:20:31.782 --> 01:20:34.551
For the first time in 40 years.
I gotta go tell Milo.

01:20:34.685 --> 01:20:36.720
- Be careful out there, Grandpa.
- Yeah.

01:20:36.854 --> 01:20:38.221
- How's your ankle?
- Hm?

01:20:38.354 --> 01:20:40.256
- Your ankle.
- It's a little sore.

01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:42.325
Not as bad
as you were making it seem.

01:20:42.458 --> 01:20:44.193
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

01:20:44.327 --> 01:20:47.063
You were making a big deal
of it. It's not that bad.

01:20:53.002 --> 01:20:54.904
Hey! Get the hell away
from that horse!

01:20:55.037 --> 01:20:56.539
Freeze!

01:20:56.673 --> 01:20:58.207
Milo! Hey!

01:20:58.341 --> 01:20:59.843
Wait, which ankle was it?

01:20:59.976 --> 01:21:01.144
- Hold it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:21:01.277 --> 01:21:02.746
Get your hands off of me!

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.047
Hey! I'm with you, Milo.

01:21:05.181 --> 01:21:06.382
I'm right here.

01:21:10.319 --> 01:21:11.789
Guys, guys.

01:21:12.856 --> 01:21:14.357
Eddie and Milo.

01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:15.425
They got them.

01:21:22.866 --> 01:21:24.434
There's ice everywhere,

01:21:24.568 --> 01:21:26.804
and there's only one road in.

01:21:26.936 --> 01:21:30.406
It's covered with guards.
I don't know how we'll get in.

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.408
Hm. Whoa!

01:21:32.542 --> 01:21:35.178
Oh, okay. I see a dungeon

01:21:35.311 --> 01:21:36.647
at the top of this ice wall.

01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:39.015
That must be where
they're keeping your grandpa.

01:21:39.148 --> 01:21:41.618
And Milo is probably
in this, like, barn thing

01:21:41.752 --> 01:21:43.754
all the way
on the other side of the place.

01:21:43.887 --> 01:21:45.988
Okay. We gotta split up.

01:21:46.122 --> 01:21:48.692
One team goes to get Milo,
the other busts out Grandpa.

01:21:48.826 --> 01:21:50.761
But how do we get in?

01:21:50.894 --> 01:21:52.261
Fridge, do you have

01:21:52.395 --> 01:21:54.932
any ice-climbing equipment
in your backpack?

01:21:56.999 --> 01:21:58.968
You mean something like this?

01:21:59.101 --> 01:22:01.638
- Just like that.
- See?

01:22:01.772 --> 01:22:03.841
That's why
I'm the backpack guy.

01:22:03.973 --> 01:22:05.809
- That's why.
- Yeah. You're great at that.

01:22:05.943 --> 01:22:07.477
Yeah, I know.

01:22:07.611 --> 01:22:10.313
Martha,
will you come with me?

01:22:10.446 --> 01:22:12.148
Of course.

01:22:22.291 --> 01:22:25.194
I forgot
what this part feels like.

01:22:25.328 --> 01:22:27.029
It's scary.

01:22:28.231 --> 01:22:30.466
- Yeah.
- Hey.

01:22:30.601 --> 01:22:33.436
We can do it.
This team can do anything.

01:22:35.004 --> 01:22:36.506
Nobody knows that
better than me.

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:40.276
- Yeah.
- Come on, you guys.

01:22:40.409 --> 01:22:41.612
Bring it in.

01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:47.016
Be aggressive.

01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:48.552
Be, be aggressive.

01:22:48.685 --> 01:22:49.987
Be aggressive.

01:22:50.119 --> 01:22:52.488
Be, be aggressive.
Come on, guys.

01:22:52.623 --> 01:22:54.457
That's not what
I thought this was. No.

01:22:54.591 --> 01:22:55.525
We should just go.

01:22:55.659 --> 01:22:58.060
Okay, just... Go, team.

01:23:13.844 --> 01:23:14.878
Okay.

01:23:15.012 --> 01:23:16.747
I'm gonna try
to sneak in with them.

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.816
In this outfit, I might be able
to pass. You guys stay here...

01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:21.618
What? No way.

01:23:21.752 --> 01:23:23.119
Now's the moment. Stay here.

01:23:23.252 --> 01:23:25.589
- Alex, no!
- Go. Good luck, Alex.

01:23:28.759 --> 01:23:30.059
Come on.

01:23:30.192 --> 01:23:32.395
What are you talking about,
"Come on"? Bethany.

01:23:32.528 --> 01:23:33.697
Bethany!

01:23:37.166 --> 01:23:39.036
Turn right.

01:23:55.586 --> 01:23:58.087
You there. Stay where you are.

01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.556
Who, us?

01:23:59.690 --> 01:24:02.593
Are you the Brothers Kababik?

01:24:02.726 --> 01:24:06.395
- Are we the who?
- Are you the Brothers Kababik?

01:24:06.529 --> 01:24:08.130
Yes.

01:24:08.264 --> 01:24:10.466
We are them. It is we. Us.

01:24:10.601 --> 01:24:14.503
We are the Brothers Cadabra...
Kadabrik.

01:24:14.638 --> 01:24:16.472
He is one brother,

01:24:16.607 --> 01:24:20.276
and I am the other brother.

01:24:20.409 --> 01:24:23.346
We... We got different mothers.

01:24:23.479 --> 01:24:27.784
But we, uh... We came to get
the thing that we came to get.

01:24:30.252 --> 01:24:31.555
Brothers Kababik,

01:24:31.688 --> 01:24:33.456
on behalf of Jurgen the Brutal,

01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:35.892
welcome to Zhatmire Stronghold.

01:24:36.026 --> 01:24:37.928
Ah, thank you.

01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.783
There's something
I have to ask you.

01:24:59.916 --> 01:25:01.283
Okay.

01:25:01.417 --> 01:25:04.253
Why didn't you come visit
when you were supposed to?

01:25:04.387 --> 01:25:06.089
You canceled the first time,

01:25:06.222 --> 01:25:08.925
then you were gonna come
for Halloween. You cancel again.

01:25:09.059 --> 01:25:10.627
Then the next time
I hear from you,

01:25:10.761 --> 01:25:12.629
you tell me
we should take a break?

01:25:15.966 --> 01:25:19.136
It's just... I saw all
your pictures on Instagram,

01:25:19.268 --> 01:25:22.171
and you looked like you
were having so much fun, and...

01:25:22.304 --> 01:25:25.742
I just got really insecure
or something.

01:25:25.876 --> 01:25:29.112
Like I wasn't the guy
I thought I was.

01:25:29.245 --> 01:25:31.882
Or I wasn't the guy
you thought I was.

01:25:32.015 --> 01:25:34.316
Which would be even worse.

01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:37.654
Spencer,
do you think I'm not...

01:25:37.788 --> 01:25:40.691
totally terrified
all the time?

01:25:40.824 --> 01:25:42.693
I got to school,
and suddenly,

01:25:42.826 --> 01:25:46.763
for the first time ever,
people really liked me.

01:25:46.897 --> 01:25:48.865
But I'm always thinking that...

01:25:48.999 --> 01:25:51.200
I don't know, like it's...

01:25:51.333 --> 01:25:52.836
Like it's just a matter of time

01:25:52.969 --> 01:25:56.039
before somebody figures out
who I really am.

01:25:56.173 --> 01:25:57.406
But then I see you.

01:25:59.475 --> 01:26:02.278
And you're the person
who makes me feel good...

01:26:02.411 --> 01:26:03.880
about who I really am.

01:26:05.247 --> 01:26:08.451
When you're, like,
scared and insecure,

01:26:08.585 --> 01:26:11.420
that's when you need
your people the most.

01:26:22.498 --> 01:26:23.399
Hey, Mr. Walker.

01:26:25.234 --> 01:26:26.770
Why the long face?

01:26:28.905 --> 01:26:31.507
Dad joke. Sorry.
Can't help it.

01:26:33.143 --> 01:26:35.946
Let's get you out of here.

01:27:04.273 --> 01:27:05.474
Okay.

01:27:05.609 --> 01:27:07.944
It's just an obstacle course.

01:27:08.078 --> 01:27:09.646
You were good at those.

01:27:25.394 --> 01:27:27.898
All right,
all right, get a room.

01:27:31.735 --> 01:27:34.470
Grandpa...
let's get you out of there.

01:27:34.604 --> 01:27:36.640
Here.

01:27:36.773 --> 01:27:39.609
- Unh!
- Whoa.

01:27:39.743 --> 01:27:41.611
Let's blow this joint, huh?

01:27:41.745 --> 01:27:43.512
We still have
to find the jewel.

01:27:43.647 --> 01:27:46.116
It must be in a vault
or treasure room or something.

01:27:46.249 --> 01:27:48.218
Yeah, that's how
it works in these games.

01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:50.386
I passed a vault
on the way up to this dump.

01:27:50.519 --> 01:27:52.823
Single access,
3-foot-thick steel door.

01:27:52.956 --> 01:27:55.491
Only way in is through
a grate in the ceiling.

01:28:03.867 --> 01:28:07.336
Hoo... Oh. Huh.

01:28:07.469 --> 01:28:09.172
I think I got it now.

01:28:11.507 --> 01:28:14.343
Just stay on...

01:28:14.476 --> 01:28:15.679
the raised ones.

01:28:38.802 --> 01:28:41.238
Jurgen the Brutal awaits.

01:28:43.505 --> 01:28:47.543
So, tell me,
which brother is which?

01:28:50.046 --> 01:28:52.015
Um, how do you mean?

01:28:52.148 --> 01:28:55.018
Which brother is which?

01:28:55.151 --> 01:28:58.387
Which of you is Augustus
and which is Tomatoli?

01:28:59.890 --> 01:29:03.660
Um... I am Augustus.

01:29:04.961 --> 01:29:06.930
And I'm Tomatolik.

01:29:08.298 --> 01:29:11.067
Augustus Kababik.

01:29:11.201 --> 01:29:13.402
The cleverest man
in all of Jumanji.

01:29:14.971 --> 01:29:16.873
Yes, I'm totally that man.

01:29:17.007 --> 01:29:19.743
- And Tomatoli Kababik.
- That's me.

01:29:19.876 --> 01:29:22.345
The bravest eunuch.

01:29:22.511 --> 01:29:25.582
- Wait a minute, what?
- Did you say, "Eunuch"?

01:29:25.715 --> 01:29:28.385
Tomatoli Kababik,
everyone knows the tale

01:29:28.517 --> 01:29:31.021
of your great
and generous sacrifice.

01:29:31.154 --> 01:29:33.256
How you gave your testicles

01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:36.226
in order to save the region
from the floods.

01:29:36.359 --> 01:29:37.761
There might be
a little confusion.

01:29:37.894 --> 01:29:39.495
Of course.
Everybody knows the story

01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:43.066
about my little brother
and his famous testicles.

01:29:43.199 --> 01:29:46.468
- Wherever they may be.
- Wherever they may be.

01:29:46.603 --> 01:29:49.172
All right, let's back up.
Let's go back a little bit.

01:29:49.306 --> 01:29:51.440
- Let's clear some stuff up.
- He's super brave.

01:29:51.574 --> 01:29:53.610
I've always been
the super clever one,

01:29:53.743 --> 01:29:55.845
and he's always been
super brave.

01:29:55.979 --> 01:29:58.114
- And super ball-less.
- Stop saying that!

01:29:58.248 --> 01:30:00.617
- Both of my balls are right here!
- In spirit.

01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:03.620
- Hey...
- They're here in spirit.

01:30:04.821 --> 01:30:05.989
Always.

01:30:07.057 --> 01:30:07.991
Of course.

01:30:09.059 --> 01:30:10.026
Right, bro?

01:30:15.298 --> 01:30:17.300
Right.

01:30:17.434 --> 01:30:20.203
I got no balls.

01:30:25.909 --> 01:30:28.011
There's the chest.

01:30:28.144 --> 01:30:30.080
Okay. You're up, Grandpa.

01:30:30.213 --> 01:30:32.849
- Who, me?
- Yes. You're the cat burglar.

01:30:32.983 --> 01:30:35.218
- Huh?
- Your character, Ming.

01:30:35.352 --> 01:30:37.053
- Ming?
- Yes, Ming.

01:30:37.187 --> 01:30:38.588
Your avatar.
That's her name.

01:30:38.722 --> 01:30:40.357
In your satchel,
you have lockpicks.

01:30:40.489 --> 01:30:43.126
Lockpicks?
Why would I have lockpicks?

01:30:43.259 --> 01:30:45.527
Because Ming's the cat burglar.

01:30:45.662 --> 01:30:47.630
Don't you think one
of you should do this?

01:30:47.764 --> 01:30:50.000
- You have the skills.
- I have the skills?

01:30:50.133 --> 01:30:52.702
Not you. Ming.

01:30:52.836 --> 01:30:54.771
Right. Ming.

01:30:56.439 --> 01:30:58.507
Please don't ask who Ming is.

01:31:08.852 --> 01:31:10.353
Not bad, huh?

01:31:12.188 --> 01:31:15.191
Now we just gotta figure out
how to get you out of here.

01:31:26.002 --> 01:31:27.237
Shall we?

01:31:29.839 --> 01:31:31.374
Huh.

01:31:31.508 --> 01:31:32.876
Now, that's cool.

01:31:36.846 --> 01:31:40.517
Welcome. May I offer you
a piece of cake?

01:31:41.584 --> 01:31:42.886
No! No!

01:31:43.019 --> 01:31:44.521
No!

01:31:48.324 --> 01:31:49.692
No, thank you.

01:32:00.336 --> 01:32:01.638
Steady.

01:32:15.018 --> 01:32:18.822
Ha! I'd like to see
your friend Ming do that!

01:32:24.127 --> 01:32:25.929
We got an issue here.

01:32:28.364 --> 01:32:30.133
Oh, thank you.

01:32:32.902 --> 01:32:34.504
Thank you.

01:32:42.645 --> 01:32:46.216
Brothers Kababik,
I present Jurgen the Brutal.

01:32:56.126 --> 01:32:57.494
At last,

01:32:57.627 --> 01:33:01.097
we meet on this historic day.

01:33:01.231 --> 01:33:05.401
Yes, it is so great
to meet you.

01:33:05.535 --> 01:33:08.938
Your Honor, if that be
the Falcon Jewel

01:33:09.072 --> 01:33:13.109
upon your thick and meaty neck,

01:33:13.243 --> 01:33:15.411
perhaps we should...

01:33:15.545 --> 01:33:17.080
take it.

01:33:17.213 --> 01:33:21.484
Today we forge
an unbreakable alliance.

01:33:21.619 --> 01:33:24.087
Your family will join me,

01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:28.858
and land by land,
we'll take the world.

01:33:28.992 --> 01:33:32.362
So I ask, on this historic day,

01:33:32.495 --> 01:33:34.030
where is she?

01:33:35.599 --> 01:33:38.034
- Uh, where's who?
- Who you talking about?

01:33:38.168 --> 01:33:39.969
Your sister.

01:33:40.103 --> 01:33:41.771
Soon to be my bride.

01:33:45.208 --> 01:33:50.079
You know what? I think that
there's been a misunderstanding.

01:33:50.213 --> 01:33:52.015
Where is your sister?

01:33:54.984 --> 01:33:57.420
Which sister were
we talking about?

01:33:57.555 --> 01:34:01.324
Debbie or... Brooke?

01:34:01.457 --> 01:34:03.393
Or Sierra?

01:34:03.526 --> 01:34:07.197
Where is your sister?

01:34:09.299 --> 01:34:11.701
She's getting ready,
back at the hotel.

01:34:11.834 --> 01:34:14.204
She's doing what brides do
on their wedding day.

01:34:14.337 --> 01:34:18.241
Hanging with the girls, getting
her hair done, mani-pedi.

01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:23.614
If you come here
without your sister...

01:34:26.382 --> 01:34:28.451
I just might have
to cut off your heads.

01:34:28.586 --> 01:34:30.753
- Oh, no! No, no, no. Don't.
- Hey. Hey. Hey!

01:34:30.887 --> 01:34:32.388
- God, no.
- Hey, get off!

01:34:32.522 --> 01:34:36.059
- No. No.
- So I'll ask one last time:

01:34:36.192 --> 01:34:39.395
- Getting a mani-pedi!
- Where is your sister?

01:34:39.529 --> 01:34:41.297
I'm right here.

01:34:49.372 --> 01:34:52.542
Gwendolyn Hortencia
Lewelda Kababik?

01:34:52.676 --> 01:34:53.677
Is that you?

01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:56.279
Um, yes.

01:34:56.412 --> 01:34:57.547
That is me.

01:34:58.815 --> 01:35:00.183
Now, please,

01:35:00.316 --> 01:35:03.953
O Brutal One,
release my brothers.

01:35:07.190 --> 01:35:09.459
And is it your
intention, on this day,

01:35:09.593 --> 01:35:13.529
at this hour, to wed
Jurgen the Brutal of Zhatmire?

01:35:15.198 --> 01:35:17.367
Yep. That's my plan.

01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:20.236
And is it your intention
to mother his children

01:35:20.370 --> 01:35:23.373
and forge in blood
this union with your family?

01:35:25.441 --> 01:35:26.476
Yes.

01:35:26.610 --> 01:35:28.612
Gwendolyn Kababik...

01:35:28.746 --> 01:35:30.614
known throughout the world

01:35:30.748 --> 01:35:33.449
for your beauty and cunning.

01:35:33.584 --> 01:35:37.086
And now you're mine.

01:35:40.256 --> 01:35:44.662
Um... May I hold
the Falcon Jewel?

01:35:46.129 --> 01:35:48.831
Of course, my bride.

01:35:48.965 --> 01:35:50.634
Thank you.

01:35:52.101 --> 01:35:53.036
Get it.

01:35:56.172 --> 01:35:57.940
Jurgen the Brutal!

01:35:58.074 --> 01:36:02.613
The Brothers Kababik
have been delayed in Gorek.

01:36:02.746 --> 01:36:04.947
These are impostors!

01:36:05.081 --> 01:36:06.784
- Impostors?
- Seize them!

01:36:06.916 --> 01:36:08.719
No, no, no.
Oh, no. We can explain.

01:36:08.851 --> 01:36:09.886
Oh, no, no, no.

01:36:10.019 --> 01:36:11.988
I forgot to tell you one thing.

01:36:14.157 --> 01:36:15.559
I have a boyfriend.

01:36:27.837 --> 01:36:29.305
Get back.
Stay back.

01:36:29.439 --> 01:36:31.240
- Stay away.
- Get back!

01:36:31.374 --> 01:36:33.343
Get back!

01:36:52.028 --> 01:36:55.865
- Get out of here!
- I will torch you, bitches.

01:36:55.998 --> 01:36:58.067
I will literally
burn your face.

01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:22.392
I'll meet the brothers
in Gorek.

01:37:22.525 --> 01:37:23.560
Kill them all!

01:37:26.062 --> 01:37:27.497
Go get him!

01:37:27.631 --> 01:37:28.665
Go get the jewel!

01:37:28.799 --> 01:37:30.868
Don't worry about us. Just go!

01:37:33.035 --> 01:37:34.203
Backpack.

01:37:37.006 --> 01:37:39.877
Get away! I know geometry.

01:37:40.009 --> 01:37:43.112
I'm not messing around,
you guys. Get away!

01:37:43.246 --> 01:37:45.281
Fridge, we're gonna die!

01:37:56.426 --> 01:37:58.394
Anybody wanna dance
with the bride?

01:39:04.728 --> 01:39:07.798
You want a piece?
Come on!

01:39:13.770 --> 01:39:15.104
Nunchucks.

01:39:27.416 --> 01:39:29.118
Awesome

01:39:34.691 --> 01:39:36.058
We did it.

01:39:36.192 --> 01:39:37.628
Let's go!

01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:48.705
- Come on, come on!
- Hurry!

01:40:01.885 --> 01:40:04.420
Whoa! Unh! Whoa!

01:40:10.393 --> 01:40:11.929
Look!

01:40:13.262 --> 01:40:14.932
- Is that Spencer?
- Oh, my God.

01:41:05.616 --> 01:41:07.116
No!

01:41:12.856 --> 01:41:13.757
Spencer!

01:41:13.890 --> 01:41:15.224
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:41:22.633 --> 01:41:24.935
Who are you?

01:41:30.641 --> 01:41:32.743
I'm Dr. Smolder Bravestone.

01:41:58.101 --> 01:42:00.436
Spencer!

01:42:02.471 --> 01:42:04.841
- He says to get on his back.
- Who, me?

01:42:37.574 --> 01:42:39.542
Oh, no. Milo!

01:42:39.676 --> 01:42:40.944
- Oh, my God.
- What's he doing?

01:42:41.078 --> 01:42:42.112
Wait.

01:42:43.379 --> 01:42:44.915
Milo!

01:42:53.757 --> 01:42:55.192
Yeah, Milo!

01:42:56.827 --> 01:42:58.061
Go!

01:43:00.731 --> 01:43:02.465
We're coming, Spencer!

01:43:06.402 --> 01:43:08.237
"Show it to the sun."

01:43:08.370 --> 01:43:09.673
Grandpa, the jewel!

01:43:09.806 --> 01:43:12.843
You gotta show it
to the sun! Get ready!

01:43:19.381 --> 01:43:21.618
Come on, Milo!

01:43:21.752 --> 01:43:23.887
- Go!
- Come on, come on!

01:43:38.201 --> 01:43:39.803
Yeah!

01:43:50.213 --> 01:43:52.215
- Call out its name.
- Call out its name.

01:43:52.348 --> 01:43:53.884
Call out its name!

01:43:54.017 --> 01:43:56.720
Jumanji!

01:43:56.853 --> 01:43:59.956
Jumanji!

01:44:00.090 --> 01:44:01.057
What'd they say?

01:44:03.359 --> 01:44:04.493
Jumanji?

01:44:09.633 --> 01:44:10.834
Oh!

01:44:33.422 --> 01:44:36.458
- Oh!
- Yes!

01:44:36.593 --> 01:44:38.394
Ha, ha, we won!

01:44:38.527 --> 01:44:40.197
- We did it!
- Hey.

01:44:41.497 --> 01:44:43.567
Put me down.

01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:45.367
- Put me down, goddamn it. Stop!
- Okay.

01:44:45.501 --> 01:44:48.171
Is this what you were
looking for? This little thing?

01:44:48.305 --> 01:44:49.906
Grandpa, you guys
were incredible.

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:53.643
Yeah, that's the thing about
Milo. He's got a lot of skills.

01:44:53.777 --> 01:44:55.045
Milo and Eddie.

01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.014
Milo and Eddie.

01:45:04.654 --> 01:45:07.090
Uh, what are we doing
here now?

01:45:14.130 --> 01:45:15.632
Whoa!

01:45:17.701 --> 01:45:19.569
Well done,
intrepid adventurers.

01:45:19.703 --> 01:45:22.339
You have saved Jumanji.
Again.

01:45:23.673 --> 01:45:25.141
And now,
with your permission,

01:45:25.275 --> 01:45:28.178
Dr. Bravestone,
I will take the jewel from here.

01:45:28.311 --> 01:45:31.047
I will protect it with my life
and return it to the care

01:45:31.181 --> 01:45:33.515
of the elder
at the Avian Province.

01:45:33.650 --> 01:45:35.819
And so your work here is done.

01:45:35.952 --> 01:45:39.756
All of Jumanji thanks you. And,
sadly, this is where we part.

01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:41.390
I don't know
what's sad about it.

01:45:41.523 --> 01:45:43.425
I'm ready to get
the hell out of here.

01:45:47.797 --> 01:45:48.832
What?

01:45:50.667 --> 01:45:52.335
Really?

01:45:54.536 --> 01:45:56.538
Hey, guys, you're not gonna
believe this.

01:45:56.673 --> 01:45:59.175
What'd he say?

01:45:59.309 --> 01:46:01.543
- He says that he...
- He wants to stay.

01:46:03.479 --> 01:46:07.516
He says somebody's gotta stay
and look after this place.

01:46:07.651 --> 01:46:10.620
And that he's 75 years old
and he just learned how to fly.

01:46:13.924 --> 01:46:16.326
But he won't be able
to get out.

01:46:17.694 --> 01:46:18.895
He knows.

01:46:22.732 --> 01:46:24.567
Oh, Milo.

01:46:27.971 --> 01:46:30.941
I feel like I, uh,
just got you back.

01:46:31.074 --> 01:46:32.776
Now I'm losing you for good.

01:46:35.145 --> 01:46:38.648
"You're not losing me, buddy.
I'll always be with you."

01:46:45.155 --> 01:46:47.290
Being your partner...

01:46:47.424 --> 01:46:51.027
is one of the best things
I ever got to be.

01:46:53.596 --> 01:46:55.165
He says, "Thank you."

01:46:55.298 --> 01:46:57.100
No, no.

01:46:57.233 --> 01:46:59.135
Thank you, Milo.

01:47:27.496 --> 01:47:29.199
Yes!

01:47:29.332 --> 01:47:31.134
- Take care, Milo!
- Bye!

01:47:31.267 --> 01:47:32.501
- Go, Milo!
- So long, Milo!

01:47:32.635 --> 01:47:34.304
Bye-bye, Mr. Walker!

01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:39.776
That's my partner right there.

01:47:45.682 --> 01:47:48.985
Everybody should be so lucky
to have a friend like Milo.

01:48:04.868 --> 01:48:07.670
Come on, Grandpa. Let's go home.

01:48:12.208 --> 01:48:13.476
Hey, guys.

01:48:15.945 --> 01:48:18.014
Thanks for coming to get me.

01:48:22.986 --> 01:48:25.755
You do it again, your ass
is gonna be stuck here, Spencer!

01:48:25.889 --> 01:48:27.223
'Cause I'm not coming back!

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:51.648
Everybody okay?

01:48:53.249 --> 01:48:54.818
Yeah.

01:48:54.951 --> 01:48:56.453
Grandpa,
you okay?

01:48:58.088 --> 01:48:59.823
Yeah, I'm good.

01:49:01.758 --> 01:49:03.827
Holy shit.

01:49:17.575 --> 01:49:19.542
Strike. Square one.
Counterstrike.

01:49:19.676 --> 01:49:21.144
The fat one on the bottom?

01:49:21.277 --> 01:49:23.546
The fat...
No, the fat one above the R.

01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:24.848
- Okay.
- Atop number two.

01:49:24.981 --> 01:49:27.417
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So strike, strike.

01:49:27.551 --> 01:49:29.619
- Yeah.
- Counterstrike.

01:49:29.752 --> 01:49:32.422
Then kick me. O.

01:49:36.626 --> 01:49:37.961
Let me tell you something.

01:49:38.094 --> 01:49:41.297
- Getting old...
- I know. Getting old sucks.

01:49:43.233 --> 01:49:44.634
Getting old...

01:49:47.770 --> 01:49:49.172
...is a gift.

01:49:51.609 --> 01:49:53.943
I forget that
sometimes.

01:49:55.044 --> 01:49:56.479
But it is.

01:50:00.783 --> 01:50:03.186
What more
could a guy possibly want?

01:50:09.292 --> 01:50:11.194
Hey, guys.

01:50:11.327 --> 01:50:13.196
How was your day?

01:50:13.329 --> 01:50:15.698
It was really great.

01:50:15.832 --> 01:50:17.500
Yeah.

01:50:17.635 --> 01:50:20.604
Spencer taught me
how to play a video game.

01:50:35.118 --> 01:50:36.486
Oh, hell, no.

01:50:48.198 --> 01:50:49.766
You okay, Grandpa?

01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:53.836
Yeah.

01:50:53.970 --> 01:50:56.072
A lot of good memories here.

01:51:07.685 --> 01:51:08.751
Eddie.

01:51:08.885 --> 01:51:10.588
Eddie, is that you?

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:12.121
Nora.

01:51:12.255 --> 01:51:14.023
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

01:51:14.157 --> 01:51:15.024
Hey, guys.

01:51:15.158 --> 01:51:16.359
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:19.262
What's up, bro?

01:51:19.395 --> 01:51:21.965
So how's business?

01:51:22.098 --> 01:51:23.567
Oh, you know how it is.

01:51:23.701 --> 01:51:26.836
My manager quit six months
ago, moved to Philly.

01:51:26.970 --> 01:51:29.539
Place has been kind of
a mess ever since.

01:51:29.673 --> 01:51:33.209
It's hard to find people
who really know how to do this.

01:51:33.343 --> 01:51:35.511
Oh, well...

01:51:35.646 --> 01:51:37.581
I don't have to tell you this.

01:51:37.715 --> 01:51:39.583
Mm.

01:51:41.084 --> 01:51:42.852
So you need some help
around here?

01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:45.788
You mean it?

01:51:45.922 --> 01:51:47.957
I mean, I...

01:51:48.091 --> 01:51:49.525
I'd be honored.

01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.060
Well...

01:51:53.229 --> 01:51:55.064
It's really good
to see you, Eddie.

01:51:56.332 --> 01:51:57.601
Likewise.

01:52:02.272 --> 01:52:03.641
Um...

01:52:07.877 --> 01:52:10.980
Um, I'm... I'm gonna take this

01:52:11.114 --> 01:52:13.983
where I was going and...

01:52:14.117 --> 01:52:16.252
I'll be right back.

01:52:16.386 --> 01:52:18.821
You guys gotta come
to New York too.

01:52:18.955 --> 01:52:21.391
Yeah, I can't wait.

01:52:21.524 --> 01:52:24.060
This team, forever.

01:52:24.193 --> 01:52:25.461
Forever.

01:52:25.596 --> 01:52:27.363
Always.

01:52:27.497 --> 01:52:29.999
Uh, always and forever?

01:52:31.635 --> 01:52:34.504
- Yeah, let's keep close though.
- Of course, yeah.

01:52:34.638 --> 01:52:36.139
One thing.

01:52:36.272 --> 01:52:37.807
Can we all agree?

01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:39.710
Let's never go back there.

01:52:39.842 --> 01:52:41.811
- We already agreed on that.
- That's fine.

01:53:22.518 --> 01:53:23.920
Sorry it's so late.

01:53:24.053 --> 01:53:25.488
Yeah, it's that time of year.

01:53:25.622 --> 01:53:27.990
- Everyone's heaters are broken.
- Oh, it's no problem.

01:53:28.124 --> 01:53:29.660
I'm just glad you made it.

01:53:29.793 --> 01:53:31.562
The furnace
is right over here.

01:53:36.667 --> 01:53:39.068
Is that
an old video game console?

01:53:39.202 --> 01:53:40.970
Hm?

01:53:41.104 --> 01:53:43.039
Oh, yeah, probably.

01:53:43.172 --> 01:53:45.375
It belongs to my son.

01:53:45.508 --> 01:53:46.976
Hm.

01:53:47.110 --> 01:53:49.580
Yeah, I'm a big gamer.

01:53:49.713 --> 01:53:51.547
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:58.555
Well, it looks like
it's broken.

01:53:59.956 --> 01:54:02.659
Maybe you shouldn't
touch it.

01:54:23.513 --> 01:54:28.513
