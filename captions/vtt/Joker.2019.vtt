00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:10.061
The News Never Ends.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.057
>> This is 1080 GCR <<

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:15.185
You get all the news you Need,
All Day Long.

00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:16.979
Good morning.

00:00:17.147 --> 00:00:20.274
It's 42 degrees at 10:30 on
this Thursday, October 15th.

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:22.776
I'm Stan I. Brooks,
& here's what's happening.

00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:25.154
It's day 18
of the garbage strike,

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:27.948
with 10,000 tons of garbage
piling up every day.

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:30.075
Even the nicest sections
of the city

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.493
are looking like slums.

00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:33.370
Health Commissioner
Edward O'Rourke is

00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:35.164
declaring a city-wide
state of emergency

00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:36.957
for the first time in decades.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:39.245
There's no need to
wait until somebody dies

00:00:39.377 --> 00:00:40.961
or comes down with typhoid fever.

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.130
It's already
a serious situation.

00:00:43.298 --> 00:00:44.400
It's something that affects

00:00:44.424 --> 00:00:45.544
almost everyone in the city,

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:47.718
no matter who they are
or where they live.

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:50.095
You can't go down
no one avenue

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.181
without seeing nothing
but garbage and rats.

00:00:52.348 --> 00:00:53.576
It's starting to
affect my business

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.869
when customers can't get in here

00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:56.685
because of
the garbage situation.

00:00:56.853 --> 00:00:58.581
I'm not out that long
to smell it,

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:00.439
but I think to look at it,
it's terrible.

00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:02.065
It don't affect me except

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.776
for the very bad smell here.

00:01:03.943 --> 00:01:04.943
It's horrific.

00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:06.320
It's a mess.

00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:07.798
I've been in this country
for 50 years,

00:01:07.822 --> 00:01:09.262
and I've never seen
anything like it.

00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:10.866
What is this world coming to?

00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:12.117
Put 'em in a room,

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:13.763
let 'em sit there and talk
until they get it over with.

00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:15.996
24 hours, 48 hours,
how long it takes.

00:01:16.456 --> 00:01:18.457
The idea of
the National Guard moving in

00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:20.000
and cleaning up is a good idea.

00:01:20.168 --> 00:01:21.288
In other news,

00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:22.936
the building industry
and landlords today

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:24.505
expressed concern
over the latest

00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:26.381
increase in heating oil prices.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.758
Renters in the metro area

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:29.259
are certain to feel the pinch...

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:05.940
Yo, what's up
with your shoes, bro?

00:02:05.964 --> 00:02:06.964
Nice outfit, pal.

00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:08.400
If you're gonna be
a clown, at least you could be

00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:10.050
a good one.
You know that, right?

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:12.363
- Hey! Hey!
- Grab it!

00:02:12.387 --> 00:02:13.387
Go, go, go!

00:02:13.555 --> 00:02:14.721
Hey!

00:02:15.098 --> 00:02:16.098
He's coming!

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:18.767
Come on, clown, let's go!
We've got the sign.

00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:20.496
- Look at him running.
- Let's go!

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.520
Stop them!

00:02:21.604 --> 00:02:23.541
Go, go, go, go!
Watch the car, watch the car!

00:02:25.942 --> 00:02:27.262
Where's your sign,
clown?

00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:29.278
Hey!

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.117
Go, clown! Come on!

00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:36.368
Stop them!

00:02:38.288 --> 00:02:39.663
Go! Come on!

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:43.333
Stop them!

00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:45.127
Come on, run!

00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:48.630
Hey!

00:02:49.883 --> 00:02:51.383
You fucking...

00:02:56.014 --> 00:02:57.973
Oh, shit! Good hit.

00:02:58.141 --> 00:02:59.892
Come on!
Beat his ass up.

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:01.859
Come on! This guy's weak.
He can't do nothing.

00:03:01.978 --> 00:03:03.896
Harder! Harder!

00:03:04.063 --> 00:03:05.314
Beat him up. Take his stuff.

00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:07.733
Let's go, let's go!
Come on. Let's go!

00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:04.206
Ha!

00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:53.296
Is it just me,

00:04:54.465 --> 00:04:56.967
or is it getting crazier
out there?

00:05:00.555 --> 00:05:03.390
- It is certainly tense.
- Hmm.

00:05:03.933 --> 00:05:05.767
People are upset.

00:05:05.935 --> 00:05:08.812
They're struggling.
Looking for work.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.355
These are tough times.

00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:14.776
How about you?

00:05:16.404 --> 00:05:18.488
Have you been keeping up
with your journal?

00:05:20.283 --> 00:05:22.034
Yes, ma'am.

00:05:23.578 --> 00:05:24.953
Great.

00:05:25.872 --> 00:05:27.414
Did you bring it with you?

00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:33.086
Arthur.

00:05:33.254 --> 00:05:35.589
Last time, I asked you
to bring your journal

00:05:35.673 --> 00:05:37.340
with you for these appointments.

00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:39.384
Can I see it?

00:05:51.355 --> 00:05:54.232
I've been using it as a journal,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.778
but also as a joke diary.

00:05:58.905 --> 00:06:02.282
Funny thoughts or observations.

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:04.576
I think I told you

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.829
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.876
No, you didn't.

00:06:14.337 --> 00:06:16.338
I think I did.

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.809
"I just hope my death makes
more sense than my life."

00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:47.160
How does it feel to
have to come here?

00:06:47.578 --> 00:06:50.330
Does it help to
have someone to talk to?

00:06:54.377 --> 00:06:55.627
I think I felt better

00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:57.712
when I was locked up
in the hospital.

00:06:59.757 --> 00:07:01.007
And have you thought more about

00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:03.760
why you were locked up?

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.268
Who knows?

00:07:18.442 --> 00:07:20.193
I was wondering
if you could ask the doctor

00:07:20.278 --> 00:07:22.195
to increase my medication.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.537
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.

00:07:31.873 --> 00:07:34.457
Surely,
they must be doing something.

00:07:37.003 --> 00:07:40.172
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.418
Would you please
stop bothering my kid?

00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:22.649
I wasn't bothering him.
I was...

00:08:22.673 --> 00:08:23.882
Just stop.

00:08:32.433 --> 00:08:34.226
What? You think that's funny?

00:08:42.526 --> 00:08:44.152
I'm sorry. I have a...

00:09:00.753 --> 00:09:01.953
I'm sorry.

00:10:40.686 --> 00:10:42.126
Happy,
did you check the mail

00:10:42.188 --> 00:10:43.521
before you came up?

00:10:43.689 --> 00:10:45.273
Yeah, Mom.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.734
Nothing.

00:10:50.905 --> 00:10:52.507
And finally, tonight,

00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:54.532
just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse,

00:10:54.867 --> 00:10:55.992
authorities are saying

00:10:56.077 --> 00:10:58.536
the city is under siege
by scores of rats.

00:10:58.704 --> 00:10:59.996
And not just any rats,

00:11:00.081 --> 00:11:02.207
but super rats,
who are hard to kill.

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:04.292
He must not be
getting my letters.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.460
Yeah.

00:11:05.669 --> 00:11:07.712
It's Thomas Wayne, Mom.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.297
He's a busy man.

00:11:09.465 --> 00:11:13.176
Please. I worked
for that family for years.

00:11:13.636 --> 00:11:15.637
The least he could do
is write back.

00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:20.350
Here.
Don't get all worked up. Eat.

00:11:20.518 --> 00:11:21.518
You need to eat.

00:11:21.685 --> 00:11:25.313
You need to eat.
Look how skinny you are.

00:11:26.857 --> 00:11:28.543
Both victims
were taken to Gotham General.

00:11:28.567 --> 00:11:29.692
Sounds like

00:11:29.777 --> 00:11:30.921
the city needs to
find the Pied Piper.

00:11:30.945 --> 00:11:33.613
He'll make a great mayor.
Everybody says so.

00:11:34.156 --> 00:11:37.575
Oh, yeah. Everybody who?
Who do you talk to?

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.537
Well, everybody on the news.

00:11:40.704 --> 00:11:42.872
He's the only one
who could save the city.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.374
He owes it to us.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.795
Come sit. It's starting.

00:11:48.963 --> 00:11:50.755
Yay, Murray.

00:11:51.632 --> 00:11:55.051
From
NCB Studios in Gotham City,

00:11:55.219 --> 00:11:58.513
it's Live with Murray Franklin!

00:11:59.515 --> 00:12:02.600
Tonight, Murray welcomes
Sandra Winger...

00:12:02.768 --> 00:12:03.977
Oh, Sandra Winger's on.

00:12:04.145 --> 00:12:07.272
And the piano stylings
of Yeldon and Chantel.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.566
Joining Murray, as always,

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.318
Ellis Drane
and his jazz orchestra.

00:12:12.486 --> 00:12:15.155
And now, without further ado,

00:12:15.322 --> 00:12:18.074
Murray Franklin.

00:12:30.337 --> 00:12:32.213
Thank you.

00:12:33.382 --> 00:12:34.507
Thank you.

00:12:34.675 --> 00:12:37.010
We got a great-looking
audience tonight.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.304
Yeah!

00:12:39.472 --> 00:12:41.181
Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

00:12:41.599 --> 00:12:42.682
Thank you.

00:12:43.309 --> 00:12:45.768
So, everybody's heard
about the super rats that

00:12:45.853 --> 00:12:48.271
- are in Gotham now, right?
- Yeah.

00:12:48.355 --> 00:12:51.733
Well, today, the mayor said
he has a solution.

00:12:51.901 --> 00:12:54.651
You ready for this?
Super cats.

00:12:59.283 --> 00:13:00.844
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...

00:13:00.868 --> 00:13:02.368
I love you, Murray!

00:13:04.246 --> 00:13:05.538
I love you, too.

00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:09.042
Hey, Bobby,
would you put the lights on?

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:10.210
Who is that?

00:13:10.377 --> 00:13:12.545
Was that you?
You wanna stand up, please?

00:13:12.713 --> 00:13:14.631
Stand up for me.

00:13:14.798 --> 00:13:15.798
Go ahead.

00:13:20.971 --> 00:13:22.680
What's your name?

00:13:23.224 --> 00:13:25.225
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

00:13:25.392 --> 00:13:27.060
- Arthur?
- My name's Arthur.

00:13:27.228 --> 00:13:28.955
Oh, okay. Well, there's
something special about you,

00:13:28.979 --> 00:13:30.021
Arthur, I could tell.

00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:31.189
Where are you from?

00:13:31.357 --> 00:13:33.066
I live right here in the city

00:13:33.234 --> 00:13:35.194
with my mother.

00:13:36.278 --> 00:13:37.464
Okay, hold on.
Hold on.

00:13:37.488 --> 00:13:38.632
There's nothing funny
about that.

00:13:38.656 --> 00:13:41.324
I lived with my mother before
I made it. Just me and her.

00:13:41.492 --> 00:13:44.327
I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,

00:13:44.495 --> 00:13:46.545
and he never came back.
Aww.

00:13:46.705 --> 00:13:48.706
I know
what that's like, Murray.

00:13:48.874 --> 00:13:51.417
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

00:13:51.585 --> 00:13:53.336
I take good care of my mother.

00:13:57.508 --> 00:14:00.426
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

00:14:00.594 --> 00:14:01.594
She does.

00:14:02.429 --> 00:14:06.307
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

00:14:06.475 --> 00:14:09.102
She says I was put here
to spread joy and laughter.

00:14:09.186 --> 00:14:10.645
Aww.

00:14:13.023 --> 00:14:14.023
Wow.

00:14:16.777 --> 00:14:19.529
I like that. I like that
a lot. Come on down.

00:14:19.697 --> 00:14:22.532
Come on. For that,
you gotta come down.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.177
Come on! Come on.

00:14:32.084 --> 00:14:33.084
Come on.

00:14:48.309 --> 00:14:50.560
Okay, we got a big show
tonight. Stay tuned.

00:14:50.728 --> 00:14:52.520
We'll be right back.

00:14:53.272 --> 00:14:54.689
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

00:14:54.857 --> 00:14:56.608
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

00:14:56.775 --> 00:14:57.984
It made my day.

00:14:58.152 --> 00:14:59.360
Thanks, Murray.

00:14:59.778 --> 00:15:01.446
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.822
the audience, all that stuff?

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.217
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:05.408
to have a kid like you.

00:15:47.993 --> 00:15:50.013
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

00:15:50.037 --> 00:15:51.704
Another day in chuckle town.

00:15:51.872 --> 00:15:52.872
Yup.

00:15:56.418 --> 00:15:57.502
You okay?

00:15:59.463 --> 00:16:01.964
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

00:16:02.716 --> 00:16:03.800
Fucking savages.

00:16:05.344 --> 00:16:07.762
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

00:16:07.846 --> 00:16:08.888
No.

00:16:09.056 --> 00:16:11.391
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

00:16:11.558 --> 00:16:12.892
All the crazy shit out there.

00:16:13.435 --> 00:16:15.144
They're animals.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.942
You know what?

00:16:26.198 --> 00:16:27.198
Here.

00:16:28.867 --> 00:16:31.650
What is it?
Take it.

00:16:32.579 --> 00:16:33.663
It's for you.

00:16:38.127 --> 00:16:40.086
You gotta
protect yourself out there.

00:16:40.838 --> 00:16:42.338
Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.

00:16:43.966 --> 00:16:45.133
Randall,

00:16:46.593 --> 00:16:49.220
I'm not supposed to have a gun.

00:16:50.764 --> 00:16:52.223
Don't sweat it, Art.

00:16:53.016 --> 00:16:54.267
No one has to know.

00:16:54.435 --> 00:16:56.769
And you can pay me back
some other time.

00:16:56.937 --> 00:16:58.146
You know you're my boy.

00:17:00.357 --> 00:17:01.357
Arthur,

00:17:01.984 --> 00:17:03.484
Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

00:17:04.236 --> 00:17:06.738
Hey, Gary. You know
what I've always wondered?

00:17:06.905 --> 00:17:08.030
No idea.

00:17:08.198 --> 00:17:10.032
Do you people call it
miniature golf

00:17:10.117 --> 00:17:11.576
or is it just golf to you?

00:17:16.832 --> 00:17:18.332
Punch him in the dick,
Gary.

00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:36.934
Hello, Hoyt.

00:17:37.102 --> 00:17:39.604
Gary said you wanted to see me.

00:17:39.772 --> 00:17:42.690
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

00:17:42.775 --> 00:17:43.816
Not quite.

00:17:43.984 --> 00:17:46.110
Just been
working on my material.

00:17:46.278 --> 00:17:48.196
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

00:17:48.363 --> 00:17:49.864
Look, I like you, Arthur.

00:17:50.032 --> 00:17:51.449
You know, a lot of the guys,

00:17:51.533 --> 00:17:53.173
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

00:17:54.077 --> 00:17:55.703
I don't even know
why I like you.

00:17:56.413 --> 00:17:57.997
But I got another complaint.

00:17:58.707 --> 00:18:01.501
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

00:18:01.668 --> 00:18:03.503
The guy said you disappeared.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.046
Never even returned his sign.

00:18:05.923 --> 00:18:07.715
Because I got jumped.

00:18:08.091 --> 00:18:09.801
Didn't you hear?

00:18:09.968 --> 00:18:11.719
For a sign?

00:18:11.887 --> 00:18:14.055
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.

00:18:14.223 --> 00:18:16.182
Just get him his sign back.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.726
He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.

00:18:18.894 --> 00:18:20.686
Why would I keep his sign?

00:18:20.854 --> 00:18:23.606
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.901
If you don't return the sign,

00:18:27.069 --> 00:18:29.111
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

00:18:30.197 --> 00:18:31.322
Are we clear?

00:18:32.866 --> 00:18:35.618
Listen, I'm trying to help you.

00:18:35.786 --> 00:18:37.745
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

00:18:37.913 --> 00:18:39.288
The other guys,

00:18:39.373 --> 00:18:41.213
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,

00:18:41.291 --> 00:18:43.251
because people
think you're weird.

00:18:43.418 --> 00:18:46.254
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.

00:19:36.054 --> 00:19:37.096
Wait, wait, wait.

00:19:37.264 --> 00:19:38.264
Wait.

00:19:41.518 --> 00:19:42.643
Thank you.

00:20:04.666 --> 00:20:07.251
This building is so awful,
isn't it?

00:20:09.129 --> 00:20:11.589
This building is so awful,
right, Mommy?

00:20:11.757 --> 00:20:14.175
Yes, we can hear you, GiGi.

00:20:14.343 --> 00:20:16.677
It's so awful, Mommy.

00:20:18.388 --> 00:20:19.388
Right, Mommy?

00:20:27.356 --> 00:20:28.856
- Good night.
- This building's

00:20:29.024 --> 00:20:30.209
- so awful, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

00:20:35.697 --> 00:20:36.697
Hey.

00:20:43.413 --> 00:20:44.413
Come on.

00:20:54.257 --> 00:20:58.010
The moon is a silver dollar

00:20:58.553 --> 00:21:01.097
Shining up in the sky

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.724
That's the dream we can buy...

00:21:03.809 --> 00:21:05.129
- Look up.
- Mmm.

00:21:05.268 --> 00:21:07.269
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.

00:21:07.437 --> 00:21:10.314
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

00:21:11.233 --> 00:21:12.513
What do you think he's gonna do?

00:21:12.609 --> 00:21:13.943
He's gonna help us.

00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:19.031
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?

00:21:19.199 --> 00:21:21.075
Why would he help us?

00:21:21.243 --> 00:21:23.828
Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.

00:21:24.705 --> 00:21:27.289
If he knew how we were living,

00:21:27.457 --> 00:21:30.918
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

00:21:32.295 --> 00:21:34.964
I can't explain it to you
any better than that.

00:21:36.842 --> 00:21:38.718
I don't want you worrying
about money, Mom.

00:21:40.053 --> 00:21:41.178
Or me.

00:21:41.638 --> 00:21:42.805
Everybody's telling me

00:21:42.889 --> 00:21:45.516
that my stand-up's
ready for the big clubs.

00:21:46.727 --> 00:21:49.311
But, Happy, what makes you
think you could do that?

00:21:49.813 --> 00:21:51.522
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:54.984
Don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?

00:22:24.848 --> 00:22:26.807
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

00:22:26.892 --> 00:22:29.226
The world is in a mess

00:22:29.311 --> 00:22:31.604
With politics and taxes
And people grinding axes

00:22:31.688 --> 00:22:32.855
There's no happiness

00:22:34.066 --> 00:22:36.400
Happiness is not a riddle

00:22:36.485 --> 00:22:39.278
When I'm listening to that
Big bass fiddle

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.625
Slap that bass
Slap it till its dizzy

00:22:52.709 --> 00:22:55.044
Slap that bass
Keep the rhythm busy

00:22:55.128 --> 00:22:57.922
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Misery, you've got to go...

00:22:58.632 --> 00:22:59.882
Hey, what's your name?

00:23:01.093 --> 00:23:02.093
Arthur.

00:23:03.095 --> 00:23:06.347
Hey, Arthur,
you're a really good dancer.

00:23:07.057 --> 00:23:08.182
I know.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.976
You know who's not?
Him.

00:23:16.608 --> 00:23:18.526
Happy, what was that?
Are you okay?

00:23:18.693 --> 00:23:19.735
Mom, what?

00:23:19.903 --> 00:23:22.029
That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

00:23:22.197 --> 00:23:24.448
I'm watching an old war movie!

00:23:24.616 --> 00:23:26.117
Turn it down!

00:23:26.368 --> 00:23:27.618
Um...

00:23:32.499 --> 00:23:34.166
Sorry, Mom.

00:23:46.888 --> 00:23:48.013
You good?

00:24:55.373 --> 00:24:57.917
It's nice to see these couples
out at my show.

00:24:58.877 --> 00:25:01.086
I have a wife.
We love to role-play.

00:25:01.171 --> 00:25:03.881
- Ooh!
- Yes, yes, very sexy.

00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:05.549
My favorite one right now is

00:25:05.717 --> 00:25:08.677
professor and senior
who really needs

00:25:08.762 --> 00:25:12.450
to pass my class to graduate.
Yes.

00:25:13.975 --> 00:25:15.351
So, I'll tell you how I operate.

00:25:15.518 --> 00:25:16.644
I'm a professor at

00:25:16.728 --> 00:25:18.247
a prestigious
New England university...

00:25:19.773 --> 00:25:23.651
And my wife is a senior
in my "Intro To Western Civ."

00:25:25.695 --> 00:25:26.862
I know. I know.

00:25:27.447 --> 00:25:30.199
Why is she a senior in the
intro? I didn't buy it either.

00:25:31.326 --> 00:25:33.160
So, she comes to me
during my office hours.

00:25:34.329 --> 00:25:35.929
It's Monday and Wednesday,
three to five.

00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:38.290
She says,
"Excuse me, Professor Lewis."

00:25:38.458 --> 00:25:40.376
I can't use my real last name
at this college

00:25:40.543 --> 00:25:42.086
'cause they don't hire Jews.

00:25:43.922 --> 00:25:45.172
It's something I'll address

00:25:45.257 --> 00:25:46.882
once I have tenure,
but for now...

00:25:47.592 --> 00:25:49.218
She says,
"Excuse me, Professor Lewis,

00:25:49.386 --> 00:25:50.613
I think I might be
in danger of failing

00:25:50.637 --> 00:25:51.845
your 'Intro to Western Civ, '

00:25:52.013 --> 00:25:53.138
and I just want you to know

00:25:53.223 --> 00:25:54.974
I'm willing to do
anything to pass."

00:25:55.767 --> 00:25:59.186
And I said, "Anything?"
And she said...

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.963
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

00:27:08.965 --> 00:27:10.507
Were you following me today?

00:27:14.054 --> 00:27:15.804
Yeah.

00:27:17.682 --> 00:27:19.516
I thought that was you.

00:27:20.352 --> 00:27:22.770
I was hoping you'd come in
and rob the place.

00:27:24.814 --> 00:27:26.357
I have a gun.

00:27:26.524 --> 00:27:28.150
I could come by tomorrow.

00:27:31.613 --> 00:27:33.072
You're so funny, Arthur.

00:27:35.325 --> 00:27:36.617
Yeah.

00:27:36.785 --> 00:27:39.286
You know, I do stand-up comedy.

00:27:39.454 --> 00:27:42.206
You should maybe
come see a show sometime.

00:27:42.916 --> 00:27:44.249
I could do that.

00:27:44.417 --> 00:27:45.542
Yeah?

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.503
Yeah. You'll let me know when?

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.670
Yeah.

00:27:55.595 --> 00:27:57.805
If you're happy
and you know it

00:27:57.889 --> 00:27:59.056
Wiggle your ears

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.140
Wiggle your ears

00:28:00.225 --> 00:28:02.434
If you're happy
and you know it

00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:04.770
Wiggle your ears

00:28:04.938 --> 00:28:07.189
If you're happy and you know it

00:28:07.273 --> 00:28:09.358
And you really want to show it

00:28:09.526 --> 00:28:11.527
If you're happy and you know it

00:28:11.611 --> 00:28:12.736
Wiggle your ears

00:28:14.155 --> 00:28:16.115
If you're happy and you know it

00:28:16.199 --> 00:28:18.659
Stomp your feet

00:28:18.743 --> 00:28:20.744
If you're happy and you know it

00:28:20.829 --> 00:28:23.122
Stomp your feet

00:28:23.289 --> 00:28:25.499
If you're happy and you know it

00:28:25.583 --> 00:28:27.709
And you really want to show it

00:28:27.877 --> 00:28:30.003
If you're happy and you know it

00:28:30.088 --> 00:28:31.338
Stomp your feet

00:28:32.715 --> 00:28:34.216
If you're happy and you know it

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.717
Shout "hurray"

00:28:35.885 --> 00:28:37.052
Shout "hurray"

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.138
If you're happy and you know it

00:28:39.222 --> 00:28:40.639
Shout "hurray"

00:28:40.807 --> 00:28:41.867
Shout "hurray"

00:28:41.891 --> 00:28:43.350
If you're happy and you know it

00:28:43.435 --> 00:28:45.115
And you really want to

00:28:45.603 --> 00:28:49.231
Hoyt, please, I love this job.

00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:51.608
Arthur, I need to know why

00:28:51.693 --> 00:28:53.819
you brought a gun
into a kids' hospital.

00:28:53.987 --> 00:28:56.947
It's a prop.
It's part of my act now.

00:28:57.115 --> 00:28:58.949
That's bullshit. Bullshit.

00:28:59.117 --> 00:29:01.201
What kind of clown
carries a fucking gun?

00:29:01.911 --> 00:29:03.328
Besides, Randall told me

00:29:03.413 --> 00:29:06.373
you tried to buy a .38
off him last week.

00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:07.583
Randall told you that?

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.878
You're a fuck-up, Arthur,
and a liar.

00:29:11.045 --> 00:29:12.125
You're fired!

00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:39.508
Jefferson Street.

00:29:39.532 --> 00:29:41.033
Next stop, Ninth Ave.

00:29:44.037 --> 00:29:45.473
I'm telling you,
she wanted my number.

00:29:45.497 --> 00:29:46.622
We should've just stayed.

00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:49.458
You're dreaming, man.
She wasn't interested at all.

00:29:49.626 --> 00:29:51.979
Are you nuts? Did you
see how close we were dancing?

00:29:52.003 --> 00:29:53.086
She was in love.

00:29:53.254 --> 00:29:54.774
She couldn't wait to
get away from you.

00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:57.216
Ryan! Ryan, am I crazy?
Tell him what you saw.

00:29:59.802 --> 00:30:01.882
Hey,
you want some French fries?

00:30:04.349 --> 00:30:05.933
Hello?

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.393
Talking to you. Hey.

00:30:08.561 --> 00:30:10.103
No, thank you.

00:30:13.066 --> 00:30:14.316
You sure?

00:30:16.194 --> 00:30:17.319
They're real good.

00:30:20.156 --> 00:30:22.908
Don't ignore him.
He's being nice to you.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.285
Whoo...

00:30:49.894 --> 00:30:51.520
Is something funny, asshole?

00:30:55.733 --> 00:30:57.109
Bitch!

00:31:03.866 --> 00:31:06.868
Isn't it rich?

00:31:07.745 --> 00:31:10.163
Are we a pair?

00:31:12.625 --> 00:31:15.294
Me here at last on the ground

00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:18.463
And you in mid-air

00:31:18.631 --> 00:31:21.633
Send in the clowns

00:31:25.763 --> 00:31:27.556
Isn't it bliss?

00:31:29.017 --> 00:31:31.018
Don't you approve?

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.187
One who keeps tearing around

00:31:34.355 --> 00:31:37.190
And one who can't move

00:31:37.358 --> 00:31:40.527
Where are the clowns?

00:31:40.695 --> 00:31:44.406
There ought to be clowns

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:57.085
So, buddy, tell us,
what's so fucking funny?

00:31:57.253 --> 00:31:58.879
Nothing.

00:32:02.925 --> 00:32:04.217
I have... I have a condition.

00:32:04.927 --> 00:32:06.887
I'll tell you what you have,
you asshole.

00:32:06.971 --> 00:32:08.096
Whoa!

00:32:10.558 --> 00:32:11.975
Please, stop!

00:32:12.977 --> 00:32:14.978
We got a kicker, huh?

00:32:15.146 --> 00:32:16.938
Hey, hold him steady.
Hold him steady.

00:32:19.442 --> 00:32:21.109
Stay down, freak!

00:32:40.046 --> 00:32:41.505
Hey!

00:33:04.028 --> 00:33:05.130
Ninth Avenue.

00:33:05.154 --> 00:33:06.321
Next stop, Hunter's Point.

00:33:06.489 --> 00:33:07.823
Hey!

00:33:13.913 --> 00:33:15.706
Stand clear of
the closing doors.

00:33:52.702 --> 00:33:55.245
Shit. Shit.

00:36:48.753 --> 00:36:50.712
I read it was
a guy in full makeup.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.340
No, it says right here
it was a mask.

00:36:53.507 --> 00:36:55.634
Either way, I think
it's good for business.

00:36:55.801 --> 00:36:58.136
They got clowns on the front
of every newspaper.

00:36:58.304 --> 00:36:59.512
Big man, what's the good word?

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.680
Hey.

00:37:03.809 --> 00:37:06.019
Hey, Arthur,
I heard what happened.

00:37:06.187 --> 00:37:07.479
Sorry, mate.

00:37:07.647 --> 00:37:08.647
Yeah.

00:37:09.315 --> 00:37:10.565
It doesn't seem fair,

00:37:10.733 --> 00:37:12.609
getting fired like that.

00:37:13.819 --> 00:37:14.903
Did you really bring a gun

00:37:14.987 --> 00:37:16.404
to the children's hospital,
Artie?

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.949
What the fuck
would you do that for?

00:37:19.116 --> 00:37:20.552
Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?

00:37:20.576 --> 00:37:21.678
If your dancing
doesn't do the trick,

00:37:21.702 --> 00:37:22.971
you're just gonna
shoot yourself?

00:37:24.372 --> 00:37:25.747
Why don't you
ask Randall about it?

00:37:26.749 --> 00:37:27.874
It was his gun.

00:37:28.334 --> 00:37:29.895
- What?
- I still owe you for that,

00:37:29.919 --> 00:37:30.961
don't I?

00:37:31.128 --> 00:37:32.879
What the fuck
are you talking about?

00:37:33.422 --> 00:37:35.215
Stop talking
out of your ass, Art.

00:37:40.346 --> 00:37:41.721
Oh, no!

00:37:43.474 --> 00:37:45.183
I forgot to punch out.

00:37:51.649 --> 00:37:53.650
And turns to sorrow

00:37:55.486 --> 00:37:59.030
King of all Hear me call

00:38:00.157 --> 00:38:04.744
Hear my name Carnival

00:38:15.506 --> 00:38:17.757
And as our city
tries to make sense

00:38:17.925 --> 00:38:21.386
of the brutal triple murder
on the subway last week,

00:38:21.554 --> 00:38:23.054
we're joined by Thomas Wayne.

00:38:23.222 --> 00:38:25.473
Happy, look,
Thomas Wayne's on TV.

00:38:25.641 --> 00:38:26.808
Yes, Mother.

00:38:26.976 --> 00:38:28.370
Thanks for
having me on, Chuck.

00:38:28.394 --> 00:38:29.686
They're asking him about

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.229
those horrible subway murders.

00:38:31.397 --> 00:38:32.677
Thank you, Thomas.
I know

00:38:32.732 --> 00:38:34.482
this is a difficult time
for you.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:36.317
Why him?

00:38:36.485 --> 00:38:38.361
Looks like he's gained weight.

00:38:38.529 --> 00:38:40.609
Yes, all three worked
for Wayne Investments.

00:38:40.948 --> 00:38:42.615
Good, decent, educated.

00:38:42.783 --> 00:38:45.410
Although I didn't know
any of them personally.

00:38:47.121 --> 00:38:48.538
Like all Wayne employees,

00:38:48.622 --> 00:38:50.915
past and present,
they're family.

00:38:51.083 --> 00:38:52.803
Did you hear that?
I told you, we're family.

00:38:52.835 --> 00:38:54.312
There now seems to be

00:38:54.336 --> 00:38:56.588
a groundswell of anti-rich
sentiment in the city.

00:38:56.756 --> 00:38:58.923
It's almost as if
our less fortunate residents

00:38:59.008 --> 00:39:01.217
are taking the side
of the killer.

00:39:01.385 --> 00:39:03.053
Yes, and it's a shame.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.512
It's one of the reasons why

00:39:04.597 --> 00:39:05.877
I'm considering a run for mayor.

00:39:06.682 --> 00:39:08.892
Gotham's lost its way.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.810
What about the eyewitness report

00:39:10.895 --> 00:39:13.605
of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask?

00:39:13.773 --> 00:39:15.774
Well,
it makes total sense to me.

00:39:15.941 --> 00:39:18.181
What kind of coward would do
something that cold-blooded?

00:39:18.319 --> 00:39:20.153
Someone who hides behind a mask.

00:39:20.738 --> 00:39:22.197
Someone who is envious

00:39:22.281 --> 00:39:25.700
of those more fortunate
than themselves,

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.204
yet they're too scared
to show their own face.

00:39:29.371 --> 00:39:32.290
And until those kind of people
change for the better,

00:39:32.458 --> 00:39:36.044
those of us who have
made something of our lives

00:39:36.212 --> 00:39:38.546
will always look
at those who haven't

00:39:38.714 --> 00:39:40.840
as nothing but clowns.

00:39:42.468 --> 00:39:44.928
Thomas Wayne, thank you
for coming in this morning.

00:39:45.096 --> 00:39:46.096
It's not funny.

00:40:07.827 --> 00:40:10.078
I heard this song on the radio
the other day,

00:40:12.915 --> 00:40:16.918
and the guy was singing
that his name was Carnival.

00:40:18.087 --> 00:40:19.170
Arthur...

00:40:19.338 --> 00:40:20.505
Which is crazy,

00:40:22.883 --> 00:40:25.927
because that's
my clown name at work.

00:40:27.012 --> 00:40:29.472
And until a little while ago,

00:40:30.724 --> 00:40:33.226
it was like nobody ever saw me.

00:40:35.271 --> 00:40:37.647
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

00:40:38.065 --> 00:40:40.441
Arthur, I have
some bad news for you.

00:40:43.779 --> 00:40:45.196
You don't listen, do you?

00:40:46.866 --> 00:40:50.869
I don't think
you ever really hear me.

00:40:51.954 --> 00:40:54.747
You just ask
the same questions every week.

00:40:54.915 --> 00:40:58.209
"How's your job? Are you
having any negative thoughts?"

00:40:59.253 --> 00:41:02.964
All I have are
negative thoughts,

00:41:03.132 --> 00:41:05.967
but you don't listen anyway.

00:41:06.135 --> 00:41:09.512
I said, for my whole life,

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.891
I didn't know
if I even really existed.

00:41:14.101 --> 00:41:15.810
But I do.

00:41:17.271 --> 00:41:21.191
And people are
starting to notice.

00:41:22.943 --> 00:41:24.694
They've cut our funding.

00:41:24.862 --> 00:41:26.529
We're closing down
our offices next week.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.158
The city has cut funding
across the board.

00:41:30.242 --> 00:41:32.202
Social Services is part of that.

00:41:32.369 --> 00:41:34.412
This is the last time
we'll be meeting.

00:41:35.372 --> 00:41:36.539
Okay.

00:41:40.753 --> 00:41:42.833
They don't give a shit
about people like you, Arthur.

00:41:45.007 --> 00:41:46.424
And they really
don't give a shit

00:41:46.508 --> 00:41:48.468
about people like me, either.

00:41:51.722 --> 00:41:53.056
Fuck.

00:42:01.273 --> 00:42:03.775
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?

00:42:06.779 --> 00:42:08.363
Who do I talk to?

00:42:10.824 --> 00:42:12.617
I'm sorry, Arthur.

00:42:15.412 --> 00:42:18.957
I think... I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.

00:42:19.625 --> 00:42:22.043
You know, like, "Can I see
myself in this long-term?"

00:42:22.211 --> 00:42:24.212
"Is it safe?"

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.838
"Is it reliable?"

00:42:26.006 --> 00:42:28.258
"Could it kill me?"

00:42:28.342 --> 00:42:30.385
Most guys, we look at sex
like parking a car.

00:42:30.552 --> 00:42:32.929
We're like, "There's a spot."

00:42:33.097 --> 00:42:34.222
"There's another spot.

00:42:34.306 --> 00:42:35.533
"That would work."

00:42:35.557 --> 00:42:38.059
"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."

00:42:39.728 --> 00:42:42.480
"Handicapped?
I hope no one sees this."

00:42:45.192 --> 00:42:47.402
All right, that's my time.
Thank you very much, guys.

00:42:52.574 --> 00:42:54.742
One more time
for Sam Morril, y'all.

00:42:56.036 --> 00:42:57.829
All right, now,
this next comic describes

00:42:57.913 --> 00:43:00.039
himself as
a lifelong Gotham resident

00:43:00.207 --> 00:43:02.583
who from a young age
was always told

00:43:02.668 --> 00:43:03.710
that his purpose in life

00:43:03.877 --> 00:43:07.880
was to bring laughter and joy
into this cold, dark world.

00:43:08.465 --> 00:43:09.825
Um... Okay.

00:43:09.967 --> 00:43:12.218
Please help me welcome
Arthur Fleck, y'all.

00:43:12.303 --> 00:43:13.344
Arthur Fleck.

00:43:37.661 --> 00:43:40.204
Hello, it's good to be here.

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.940
I hated school when I was a kid.

00:44:23.457 --> 00:44:28.252
I hated school as a kid.

00:44:29.546 --> 00:44:31.214
My mother would say,

00:44:31.382 --> 00:44:32.882
"You should enjoy it.

00:44:32.966 --> 00:44:35.009
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:37.720
"No, I won't, Ma,

00:44:37.805 --> 00:44:39.472
I'm gonna be a comedian."

00:44:48.732 --> 00:44:49.899
Um...

00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:53.236
Here's one.

00:44:54.655 --> 00:44:57.573
You know, I was
just thinking the other day,

00:44:57.658 --> 00:44:59.617
why are the rich people...

00:45:06.208 --> 00:45:07.602
Smile though your heart is aching

00:45:10.963 --> 00:45:15.341
Smile even though it's breaking

00:45:17.678 --> 00:45:23.391
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

00:45:23.892 --> 00:45:28.938
If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow

00:45:29.022 --> 00:45:34.068
Smile and maybe tomorrow

00:45:34.278 --> 00:45:40.032
You'll see the sun
Come shining through for you

00:45:40.117 --> 00:45:41.451
You believe that shit?

00:45:43.287 --> 00:45:44.287
Fuck 'em.

00:45:46.331 --> 00:45:48.958
I think the guy
that did it is a hero.

00:45:51.128 --> 00:45:52.962
Three less pricks
in Gotham City,

00:45:53.422 --> 00:45:55.339
only a million more to go.

00:45:57.009 --> 00:45:59.844
You'll get by

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:04.182
That's the time you must keep on trying

00:46:04.766 --> 00:46:08.936
Smile, what's the use of crying

00:46:09.104 --> 00:46:13.566
You'll find that
Life is still worthwhile

00:46:15.819 --> 00:46:19.697
If you just smile

00:46:27.206 --> 00:46:28.641
And, buddy, as always,

00:46:28.665 --> 00:46:29.790
thanks for the laughs.

00:46:29.958 --> 00:46:31.459
I'm sure we'll see you again.

00:46:31.627 --> 00:46:32.835
You know we'll be here, right?

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.212
I hope.

00:46:34.296 --> 00:46:37.965
Tomorrow night, we have
Diana Hudson, Greg Gordon,

00:46:38.133 --> 00:46:40.927
and animal expert, Hugh Little.

00:46:41.595 --> 00:46:42.887
Thanks for watching.

00:46:43.055 --> 00:46:45.348
Good night, and always remember,

00:46:45.516 --> 00:46:46.993
that's life.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:52.396
That's life.

00:46:57.236 --> 00:47:00.613
Momma, time to wake up
and go to bed.

00:47:00.697 --> 00:47:01.822
Hmm? Oh...

00:47:04.076 --> 00:47:05.535
Oh, Happy.

00:47:08.372 --> 00:47:10.039
Happy, I wrote a new letter.

00:47:10.207 --> 00:47:11.916
Come on, dance with me.

00:47:12.918 --> 00:47:15.294
For Thomas Wayne.
It's important.

00:47:24.221 --> 00:47:25.930
You smell like cologne.

00:47:26.098 --> 00:47:28.558
It's 'cause
I just had a big date.

00:47:28.725 --> 00:47:30.518
Oh.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:34.981
Just don't forget to mail it.

00:48:00.799 --> 00:48:02.527
The Murray Franklin
Show is taped live

00:48:02.551 --> 00:48:03.926
before a studio audience

00:48:04.094 --> 00:48:06.220
in beautiful downtown
Gotham City.

00:49:08.575 --> 00:49:11.160
You're gonna kill me. You're
gonna give me a heart attack!

00:49:11.328 --> 00:49:12.495
Don't give me your...

00:49:12.663 --> 00:49:14.497
No. No.

00:49:14.665 --> 00:49:17.625
I'm not talking to you
until you stop being angry!

00:49:17.793 --> 00:49:20.211
Okay.

00:49:24.925 --> 00:49:27.051
I'm not angry, Mom.

00:49:27.219 --> 00:49:30.853
I'm not angry.
Please.

00:49:31.973 --> 00:49:34.725
Mom, is this real?

00:49:38.397 --> 00:49:41.607
He's an extraordinary man,
Happy.

00:49:41.775 --> 00:49:44.110
He's a very powerful man.

00:49:45.654 --> 00:49:47.613
We were in love.

00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:50.408
He said it was best that
we not be together

00:49:50.492 --> 00:49:52.618
because of appearances.

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.457
And I could never
tell anyone because...

00:50:01.002 --> 00:50:02.461
Well, I signed some papers.

00:50:04.297 --> 00:50:05.923
And besides, you can imagine

00:50:06.007 --> 00:50:09.385
what people would say
about Thomas and me.

00:50:12.097 --> 00:50:13.472
What they'd say about you.

00:50:17.686 --> 00:50:19.603
What would they say, Mom?

00:52:08.755 --> 00:52:09.755
Hmm.

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.725
Hmm.

00:52:52.841 --> 00:52:53.883
Hi.

00:52:56.845 --> 00:52:58.220
What's your name?

00:52:59.472 --> 00:53:01.098
I'm Bruce.

00:53:02.183 --> 00:53:03.350
Bruce.

00:53:05.312 --> 00:53:06.562
I'm Arthur.

00:53:28.543 --> 00:53:29.919
That's better.

00:53:30.837 --> 00:53:32.421
Bruce! Bruce!

00:53:33.924 --> 00:53:35.090
Get away from that man.

00:53:35.258 --> 00:53:37.384
It's okay. I'm a good guy.

00:53:37.552 --> 00:53:38.802
What are you doing?
Who are you?

00:53:39.429 --> 00:53:41.096
I'm here to see Mr. Wayne.

00:53:41.264 --> 00:53:43.766
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

00:53:45.185 --> 00:53:46.495
Why did you give him
these flowers?

00:53:46.519 --> 00:53:47.728
No, they're not real.

00:53:49.481 --> 00:53:51.523
It's magic.

00:53:51.983 --> 00:53:53.400
I was just trying to
make him smile.

00:53:53.568 --> 00:53:55.402
Well, it's not funny, is it?

00:53:56.404 --> 00:53:57.613
Do I need to call the police?

00:53:57.781 --> 00:53:59.198
No. Please.

00:54:00.492 --> 00:54:03.702
My mother's name is Penny.
Penny Fleck.

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:05.097
She used to work here years ago.

00:54:05.121 --> 00:54:07.206
Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?

00:54:08.375 --> 00:54:09.833
You are her son.

00:54:10.001 --> 00:54:11.001
Yeah.

00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:13.379
Did you know her?

00:54:17.008 --> 00:54:19.343
I know about the two of them.

00:54:19.928 --> 00:54:22.346
She told me everything.

00:54:24.224 --> 00:54:26.016
There's nothing to know.

00:54:27.143 --> 00:54:28.936
There is no "them."

00:54:29.896 --> 00:54:32.064
Your mother was delusional.

00:54:32.983 --> 00:54:34.066
She was a sick woman.

00:54:34.234 --> 00:54:36.276
Don't say that.

00:54:37.445 --> 00:54:38.862
Just go.

00:54:38.989 --> 00:54:39.989
Mmm?

00:54:40.115 --> 00:54:42.366
Before you
make a fool of yourself.

00:54:44.035 --> 00:54:46.704
Thomas Wayne is my father.

00:54:51.751 --> 00:54:52.751
He left me.

00:54:55.588 --> 00:54:56.948
Let go! Let go!

00:55:23.241 --> 00:55:25.075
Keep the respirations above 15.

00:55:25.243 --> 00:55:27.411
Slow and steady.
We got some stairs coming up.

00:55:28.663 --> 00:55:29.872
Mom?

00:55:30.707 --> 00:55:31.707
What happened?

00:55:31.875 --> 00:55:33.542
- Who are you?
- I'm her son.

00:55:33.626 --> 00:55:35.187
- What happened?
- You can probably help us out inside.

00:55:35.211 --> 00:55:36.628
We don't know what happened yet.

00:55:36.713 --> 00:55:38.691
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.
- Step.

00:55:38.715 --> 00:55:40.026
One more.
We got one more lift.

00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:41.091
I'm getting

00:55:41.176 --> 00:55:42.403
a little resistance here,
Michael.

00:55:45.096 --> 00:55:46.096
Lift.

00:55:51.644 --> 00:55:52.978
I'm right here.

00:55:53.354 --> 00:55:54.563
Excuse me, sir.

00:55:54.814 --> 00:55:55.916
Does your mother take
any medications?

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.024
- No.
- Excuse me,

00:55:57.108 --> 00:55:58.188
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.

00:55:58.234 --> 00:55:59.879
Sir, when was the last time
you spoke to her?

00:55:59.903 --> 00:56:01.070
I don't know.

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:47.199
Mr. Fleck.

00:56:48.576 --> 00:56:50.536
Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.

00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:52.913
This is my partner,
Detective Burke.

00:56:53.331 --> 00:56:55.999
We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,

00:56:57.502 --> 00:56:59.002
so we spoke with your mother.

00:57:00.755 --> 00:57:01.755
Oh.

00:57:02.924 --> 00:57:04.341
What did you say to her?

00:57:04.509 --> 00:57:05.509
Did you do this?

00:57:05.677 --> 00:57:06.677
What? No.

00:57:06.845 --> 00:57:09.304
No, no, no. We just
asked her some questions,

00:57:09.472 --> 00:57:10.973
and she got hysterical.

00:57:11.141 --> 00:57:12.891
Hyperventilating,

00:57:13.059 --> 00:57:14.328
collapsed and
hit her head pretty hard.

00:57:14.352 --> 00:57:16.478
Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.

00:57:17.105 --> 00:57:18.939
We're sorry to hear about that.

00:57:19.816 --> 00:57:22.651
But, like I said, I still have
some questions for you.

00:57:22.819 --> 00:57:24.099
They're about
the subway killings

00:57:24.154 --> 00:57:25.195
that happened last week.

00:57:25.363 --> 00:57:26.655
You've heard about them, right?

00:57:26.823 --> 00:57:27.906
Yeah.

00:57:28.074 --> 00:57:29.074
It's horrible.

00:57:29.242 --> 00:57:30.450
Right.

00:57:31.411 --> 00:57:34.538
So, we spoke with your boss
over at Haha's.

00:57:34.706 --> 00:57:36.748
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun

00:57:36.833 --> 00:57:38.292
into the children's hospital.

00:57:39.794 --> 00:57:41.795
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

00:57:41.963 --> 00:57:43.505
It's part of my act.

00:57:43.923 --> 00:57:45.257
I'm a party clown.

00:57:45.425 --> 00:57:47.342
All right.
So, why were you fired?

00:57:50.638 --> 00:57:53.182
They said I wasn't funny enough.

00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:55.309
Can you imagine that?

00:57:55.476 --> 00:57:59.313
If you don't mind, I have to
go take care of my mother.

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.732
Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.

00:58:03.943 --> 00:58:06.278
This condition of yours,
the laughing,

00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:08.363
is it real,

00:58:08.531 --> 00:58:10.365
or some sort of clown thing?

00:58:10.909 --> 00:58:13.410
- A clown thing?
- Yeah.

00:58:13.828 --> 00:58:16.121
I mean, is it part of your act?

00:58:18.708 --> 00:58:20.042
What do you think?

00:58:25.965 --> 00:58:27.049
It's exit only.

00:58:51.532 --> 00:58:53.533
She's gonna be okay.

00:58:57.997 --> 00:58:59.706
I'm gonna get a coffee.

00:59:00.416 --> 00:59:01.416
You want one?

00:59:01.584 --> 00:59:02.584
Yeah.

00:59:15.723 --> 00:59:18.684
So, the other night,
I told my youngest son Billy,

00:59:18.851 --> 00:59:21.311
you know, the new one,
the not-so-bright one.

00:59:22.146 --> 00:59:23.647
I told him, "The garbage strike

00:59:23.731 --> 00:59:24.982
is still going on, Billy."

00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:27.234
And he says, and I'm
not kidding, Billy says,

00:59:27.402 --> 00:59:29.362
"So, where are we gonna get
all our garbage from?"

00:59:36.744 --> 00:59:39.204
And finally,
in a world where everyone

00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:40.622
thinks they could do my job,

00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:43.000
we got this video tape
from Pogo's Comedy Club,

00:59:43.084 --> 00:59:44.209
right here in Gotham.

00:59:44.377 --> 00:59:46.337
Here's a guy who thinks
if you just keep laughing,

00:59:46.462 --> 00:59:48.171
it'll somehow make you funny.

00:59:48.256 --> 00:59:49.589
Check out this joker.

00:59:55.346 --> 00:59:56.388
Oh, my God.

00:59:56.472 --> 01:00:00.017
I hated school as a kid.

01:00:00.893 --> 01:00:03.937
But my mother would always say,

01:00:04.105 --> 01:00:05.689
"You should enjoy it.

01:00:05.773 --> 01:00:07.899
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

01:00:08.693 --> 01:00:10.110
"No, I won't, Ma.

01:00:10.194 --> 01:00:11.903
I'm gonna be a comedian."

01:00:18.244 --> 01:00:20.329
You shoulda listened
to your mother.

01:00:22.582 --> 01:00:24.166
Hey, one more.
One more, Bobby.

01:00:24.334 --> 01:00:26.752
All right, let's see one more.
I love this guy.

01:00:27.587 --> 01:00:28.587
It's funny,

01:00:29.464 --> 01:00:31.590
when I was a little boy

01:00:31.758 --> 01:00:34.593
and told people
I was gonna be a comedian,

01:00:34.761 --> 01:00:36.803
everyone laughed at me.

01:00:36.971 --> 01:00:39.765
Well, no one's laughing now.

01:00:43.269 --> 01:00:45.145
You can say that again, pal.

01:00:50.943 --> 01:00:53.779
All right, we got a great show
for you tonight.

01:00:53.946 --> 01:00:57.115
Chuck Conby is here,
actress Joanne Mulligan,

01:00:57.283 --> 01:01:01.119
and new music from
Mel Rubin and the Stiffs.

01:01:07.085 --> 01:01:09.628
As tensions mount
around the metro area,

01:01:09.796 --> 01:01:13.382
Mayor Stokes has pleaded
for cooler heads to prevail.

01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:15.133
City services
have been affected,

01:01:15.301 --> 01:01:17.302
and some businesses have decided

01:01:17.387 --> 01:01:20.180
to remain closed
amid the unrest.

01:01:20.348 --> 01:01:22.933
Chuck Stevens filed this report.

01:01:23.101 --> 01:01:24.328
The anger and resentment

01:01:24.352 --> 01:01:25.788
that's been building
in the city for weeks

01:01:25.812 --> 01:01:27.813
seems close to exploding.

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.023
Protesters,
many dressed as clowns,

01:01:30.108 --> 01:01:31.233
took to the streets today

01:01:31.442 --> 01:01:33.235
in one of
several planned demonstrations

01:01:33.319 --> 01:01:34.861
taking on the city's elite,

01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:36.780
including a massive rally
outside

01:01:36.864 --> 01:01:39.282
tomorrow night's
benefit at Wayne Hall.

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:41.095
What's the point of all this?

01:01:41.119 --> 01:01:42.953
- the rich.
- Thomas Wayne.

01:01:43.037 --> 01:01:44.723
That's what this whole
thing is about.

01:01:44.747 --> 01:01:46.623
the whole system.

01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:47.935
Wayne,
who recently announced

01:01:47.959 --> 01:01:49.167
he is running for mayor,

01:01:49.335 --> 01:01:51.044
will be attending the benefit.

01:01:51.212 --> 01:01:53.213
You might remember
it was Thomas Wayne

01:01:53.381 --> 01:01:54.756
who first referred to

01:01:54.841 --> 01:01:57.634
many of Gotham's residents
as "clowns."

01:01:57.802 --> 01:02:00.804
Today, he offered little in
the way of an apology.

01:02:00.972 --> 01:02:02.222
Well, what I will say is,

01:02:02.306 --> 01:02:03.575
there's something wrong
with those people.

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:04.599
I am here to help them.

01:02:04.767 --> 01:02:06.120
I'm gonna
lift them out of poverty,

01:02:06.144 --> 01:02:07.561
help make their lives better.

01:02:07.728 --> 01:02:08.895
That is why I'm running.

01:02:09.063 --> 01:02:11.815
And they may not realize it,
but I'm their only hope.

01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:30.333
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

01:02:30.418 --> 01:02:33.170
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

01:05:13.748 --> 01:05:14.831
Can I help you, pal?

01:05:17.084 --> 01:05:18.752
I don't know what to say.

01:05:22.381 --> 01:05:24.591
Do you want an autograph
or something?

01:05:24.759 --> 01:05:25.759
No.

01:05:31.891 --> 01:05:33.433
My name is Arthur.

01:05:35.019 --> 01:05:36.645
Penny Fleck is my mother.

01:05:38.022 --> 01:05:39.022
Jesus.

01:05:40.107 --> 01:05:41.947
You're the guy that came to
my house yesterday.

01:05:43.361 --> 01:05:44.611
Yes.

01:05:45.154 --> 01:05:47.030
I'm sorry I just showed up.

01:05:47.198 --> 01:05:48.657
But my mother
told me everything,

01:05:48.741 --> 01:05:50.408
and I had to talk to you.

01:05:50.576 --> 01:05:52.494
Look, pal, I'm not your father.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.579
What's wrong with you?

01:05:56.248 --> 01:05:57.791
Look at us.

01:05:59.293 --> 01:06:00.543
I think you are.

01:06:00.711 --> 01:06:01.920
Well, that's impossible

01:06:02.505 --> 01:06:03.755
because you're adopted,

01:06:03.839 --> 01:06:05.067
and I never slept with
your mother.

01:06:05.091 --> 01:06:06.693
- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?

01:06:06.717 --> 01:06:08.093
- Money?
- No, I don't...

01:06:08.177 --> 01:06:09.302
I wasn't adopted.

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:11.262
Jesus. She never told you?

01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:13.098
Told me what?

01:06:14.433 --> 01:06:16.411
Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.

01:06:16.435 --> 01:06:17.644
That's not true.

01:06:18.187 --> 01:06:19.187
Why are you saying that?

01:06:19.355 --> 01:06:20.415
Then she was arrested
and committed

01:06:20.439 --> 01:06:21.606
to Arkham State Hospital,

01:06:21.774 --> 01:06:23.149
when you were just a little boy.

01:06:23.317 --> 01:06:24.442
Why are you saying this?

01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:26.111
I don't need you to
tell me lies.

01:06:26.278 --> 01:06:27.612
I know it seems strange.

01:06:27.697 --> 01:06:29.322
I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:31.074
I don't know
why everyone is so rude.

01:06:31.242 --> 01:06:32.450
I don't know why you are.

01:06:32.618 --> 01:06:33.952
I don't want anything from you.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.496
Maybe a little bit of warmth,
maybe a hug, Dad!

01:06:36.664 --> 01:06:38.665
How about just a little bit
of fucking decency?

01:06:38.833 --> 01:06:40.208
What is it with you people?

01:06:40.376 --> 01:06:42.335
You say that stuff
about my mother.

01:06:42.503 --> 01:06:43.878
She's crazy.

01:06:43.963 --> 01:06:46.047
She's...

01:06:53.639 --> 01:06:55.014
You think this is funny?

01:06:56.642 --> 01:06:59.811
Dad, it's me. Come on.

01:07:02.523 --> 01:07:03.690
Touch my son again,

01:07:03.774 --> 01:07:05.214
I'll fucking kill you.

01:07:25.087 --> 01:07:27.881
Hello, Mr. Fleck.
This is Detective Garrity.

01:07:28.048 --> 01:07:30.383
We met the other night
at Gotham General.

01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:32.844
My partner and I had a few
more questions for you.

01:07:33.012 --> 01:07:35.930
We stopped by your apartment
today, but you weren't home.

01:07:36.098 --> 01:07:37.978
Please give me a call
when you get this message.

01:07:38.017 --> 01:07:39.934
Again, Detective Garrity,

01:07:40.102 --> 01:07:44.105
and my number is 212... 99.

01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:28.983
This message is
for Arthur Fleck.

01:08:29.151 --> 01:08:30.860
My name is Shirley Woods.

01:08:30.945 --> 01:08:33.112
I work on
The Murray Franklin Show.

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.424
I don't know if you're aware,

01:08:34.448 --> 01:08:36.048
but Murray played
a clip of your stand-up

01:08:36.075 --> 01:08:37.116
on the show recently,

01:08:37.284 --> 01:08:40.578
and we have gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.

01:08:40.746 --> 01:08:42.956
Murray asked me to give you
a call and see if you're...

01:08:47.378 --> 01:08:48.711
Who is this?

01:08:48.879 --> 01:08:50.505
Oh, hi, this is Shirley Woods.

01:08:50.673 --> 01:08:53.466
I'm the show Booker from
Live with Murray Franklin.

01:08:53.634 --> 01:08:54.676
Is this Arthur?

01:08:56.679 --> 01:08:57.679
Yes.

01:08:57.847 --> 01:08:59.806
Hi, Arthur.
Well, as I was saying,

01:08:59.890 --> 01:09:01.891
we've gotten a lot of calls
about your clip.

01:09:02.059 --> 01:09:03.768
Amazing responses.

01:09:03.936 --> 01:09:06.229
And Murray asked
if I would reach out to you

01:09:06.313 --> 01:09:07.939
to see if you would
come on as his guest.

01:09:13.237 --> 01:09:16.364
Murray wants me
on The Murray Franklin Show?

01:09:16.532 --> 01:09:18.116
Yeah. Isn't that great?

01:09:18.284 --> 01:09:21.160
He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act?

01:09:22.162 --> 01:09:24.330
That sound good to you?

01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:30.712
Yeah, that sounds great.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.714
Can we set up a date right now?

01:09:32.798 --> 01:09:34.507
Are you available next Thursday?

01:10:27.227 --> 01:10:28.227
Hey.

01:10:29.063 --> 01:10:32.023
Man,
I'm sorry about that, my man.

01:10:32.191 --> 01:10:34.461
All records 10 years or older,
they store in the basement,

01:10:34.485 --> 01:10:37.487
and you're talking about
something 30 years ago, so...

01:10:38.864 --> 01:10:40.823
Can I ask you a question?

01:10:40.991 --> 01:10:42.200
Sure.

01:10:42.785 --> 01:10:46.704
How does someone
wind up in here?

01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:51.292
Have they all, all the people
committed crimes?

01:10:51.919 --> 01:10:53.586
Well, yeah, some have.

01:10:53.754 --> 01:10:56.631
You know, some are just crazy.

01:10:56.799 --> 01:10:59.258
Pose dangers to
themselves and others.

01:10:59.426 --> 01:11:01.010
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

01:11:01.095 --> 01:11:03.179
Don't know what to do, you know?

01:11:03.347 --> 01:11:07.016
- Yeah. I hear you, brother.
- Hmm.

01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:09.936
Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.148
Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.

01:11:15.609 --> 01:11:19.237
I thought it was gonna bother
me, but it really hasn't.

01:11:20.572 --> 01:11:21.572
What's that?

01:11:23.117 --> 01:11:26.494
I fucked up and
did some bad shit.

01:11:30.416 --> 01:11:31.601
You know what I'm talking about,

01:11:31.625 --> 01:11:36.963
it's so hard to just try and
be happy all the time.

01:11:39.049 --> 01:11:40.758
Hey, listen, man.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.219
I'm just
an administrative assistant.

01:11:43.303 --> 01:11:44.804
Like a clerk, you know.

01:11:44.972 --> 01:11:46.556
All I do is file paperwork.

01:11:47.683 --> 01:11:49.392
I don't know what to tell you.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.752
But you should see somebody.
You know, they got programs,

01:11:52.855 --> 01:11:55.398
city services, stuff like that.

01:11:55.566 --> 01:11:56.899
Oh, yeah.

01:11:56.984 --> 01:11:58.664
They cut all those.

01:12:03.657 --> 01:12:05.658
All right, here it is.
Fleck.

01:12:05.826 --> 01:12:07.744
Penny Fleck. Let's see.

01:12:08.662 --> 01:12:12.248
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner.

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:17.837
Oh. "The patient suffers
from delusional psychosis

01:12:18.005 --> 01:12:21.466
and narcissistic
personality disorder." Mmm.

01:12:22.051 --> 01:12:23.760
"Was found guilty of endangering

01:12:23.844 --> 01:12:27.263
the welfare
of her own child."

01:12:35.564 --> 01:12:36.564
What?

01:12:39.985 --> 01:12:41.444
You said she's your mother.

01:12:46.408 --> 01:12:47.533
Uh...

01:12:47.743 --> 01:12:50.119
I'm sorry, man. Like I said,
I can't release these records,

01:12:50.287 --> 01:12:53.039
you know, without proper forms.

01:12:53.499 --> 01:12:55.166
I could get in trouble.

01:12:55.959 --> 01:12:58.002
Look, if you want to bring
your mom in here to sign,

01:12:58.170 --> 01:12:59.170
that'll be much easier,

01:12:59.338 --> 01:13:02.381
but I can't let this go
without her signature, okay?

01:13:02.549 --> 01:13:03.549
I'm sorry.

01:13:07.721 --> 01:13:09.931
No, man! Shit!

01:13:10.516 --> 01:13:12.391
Come on, man. Give it...

01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:15.603
Hey! Hey!

01:14:13.787 --> 01:14:16.706
We went over this,
Penny. You adopted him.

01:14:17.416 --> 01:14:19.208
We have all the paperwork
right here.

01:14:19.918 --> 01:14:22.128
That's not true.

01:14:22.296 --> 01:14:24.547
Thomas had that all made up,

01:14:24.715 --> 01:14:27.341
so it stayed our secret.

01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:31.679
You also stood by

01:14:32.306 --> 01:14:33.639
while one of your boyfriends

01:14:33.724 --> 01:14:37.185
repeatedly abused
your adopted son

01:14:38.562 --> 01:14:39.562
and battered you.

01:14:59.333 --> 01:15:00.917
Penny,

01:15:01.501 --> 01:15:05.129
your son was found tied
to a radiator

01:15:05.297 --> 01:15:07.715
in your filthy apartment.

01:15:07.883 --> 01:15:10.384
Malnourished with multiple
bruises across his body

01:15:10.552 --> 01:15:12.553
and severe trauma to his head.

01:15:14.723 --> 01:15:16.432
I never heard him cry.

01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:20.811
He's always been
such a happy little boy.

01:17:21.892 --> 01:17:23.309
It's time for bed.

01:17:26.813 --> 01:17:27.813
Oh, my God!

01:17:28.774 --> 01:17:30.734
What are you doing in here?

01:17:32.986 --> 01:17:34.862
You're in the wrong apartment.

01:17:41.495 --> 01:17:43.204
Your name's Arthur, right?

01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:45.039
You live down the hall.

01:17:48.251 --> 01:17:50.044
I really need you to leave.

01:17:54.341 --> 01:17:57.301
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.

01:18:02.432 --> 01:18:03.516
Please.

01:18:06.186 --> 01:18:08.437
I had a bad day.

01:18:11.274 --> 01:18:13.776
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?

01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:41.739
Shut up!

01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:02.343
Hey, Penny.

01:20:04.804 --> 01:20:06.138
Penny Fleck.

01:20:14.314 --> 01:20:16.148
I always hated that name.

01:20:19.778 --> 01:20:21.695
You know how you used to tell me

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:26.367
that my laugh was a condition?

01:20:27.911 --> 01:20:29.995
That there was
something wrong with me?

01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:34.291
There isn't.

01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:38.504
That's the real me.

01:20:39.339 --> 01:20:40.839
Happy.

01:20:43.051 --> 01:20:45.511
Happy. Hmm.

01:20:48.848 --> 01:20:51.642
I haven't been happy

01:20:51.726 --> 01:20:53.978
one minute of
my entire fucking life.

01:21:00.944 --> 01:21:02.361
You know what's funny?

01:21:05.115 --> 01:21:06.907
You know
what really makes me laugh?

01:21:09.286 --> 01:21:11.704
I used to think
that my life was a tragedy...

01:21:13.456 --> 01:21:15.457
But now I realize

01:21:15.625 --> 01:21:17.209
it's a fucking comedy.

01:22:27.739 --> 01:22:28.906
A very fine actor.

01:22:29.074 --> 01:22:32.076
He's got a new movie
called American Playboy

01:22:32.243 --> 01:22:34.119
opening this week
across the country.

01:22:34.287 --> 01:22:36.121
Will you please welcome
a good friend

01:22:36.206 --> 01:22:38.290
of the show, Mr. Ethan Chase.

01:22:57.977 --> 01:22:59.830
Good to see you, Ethan.
You're looking great, Ethan.

01:22:59.854 --> 01:23:01.791
Thank you very much.
You're looking good yourself.

01:23:01.815 --> 01:23:02.935
Ah, can't complain.

01:23:03.316 --> 01:23:05.609
Hey, Murray.
Thanks so much for having...

01:23:06.945 --> 01:23:07.986
Hey, Murray.

01:23:08.154 --> 01:23:10.155
Thank you so much for
having me on the show.

01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.866
It's been
a lifelong dream of mine.

01:23:15.161 --> 01:23:16.401
I'm nervous right now.

01:23:18.164 --> 01:23:19.844
- You are?
- I am nervous.

01:23:20.417 --> 01:23:21.959
Hey, Murray. I've been on...

01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:36.849
I'm sorry. What's that?

01:23:38.226 --> 01:23:40.018
Oh, that's very funny, Murray.

01:23:41.312 --> 01:23:43.480
You know, I'm also a comedian.

01:23:43.648 --> 01:23:44.940
Would you like to hear a joke?

01:23:46.151 --> 01:23:48.360
Yeah? All of you?

01:23:48.862 --> 01:23:49.862
Okay.

01:23:52.907 --> 01:23:53.991
Knock...

01:23:54.075 --> 01:23:55.200
Knock, knock.

01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:10.382
Knock, knock.

01:24:31.321 --> 01:24:32.488
That's life

01:24:32.572 --> 01:24:34.281
That's life

01:24:34.365 --> 01:24:37.284
That's what all the people say

01:24:38.703 --> 01:24:41.580
You're riding high in April

01:24:41.664 --> 01:24:44.333
Shot down in May

01:24:44.417 --> 01:24:49.087
But I know I'm gonna change that tune

01:24:50.632 --> 01:24:55.260
When I'm back on top
Back on top in June

01:24:55.845 --> 01:24:58.263
I said, that's life

01:24:58.348 --> 01:25:00.390
That's life

01:25:00.475 --> 01:25:03.685
And as funny as it may seem

01:25:04.395 --> 01:25:06.730
Some people get their kicks

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.108
Stompin' on a dream

01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:14.613
But I don't let it,
let it get me down

01:25:16.407 --> 01:25:18.742
'Cause this fine old world

01:25:18.827 --> 01:25:21.328
It keeps spinnin' around

01:25:22.163 --> 01:25:25.415
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:29.002
A poet, a pawn and a king

01:25:29.087 --> 01:25:33.131
I've been up and down and over and out

01:25:33.216 --> 01:25:35.342
And I know one thing

01:25:35.426 --> 01:25:41.056
Each time I find myself flat on my face

01:25:42.058 --> 01:25:48.230
I pick myself up
And get back in the race

01:25:48.314 --> 01:25:49.439
That's life

01:25:49.524 --> 01:25:51.204
That's life

01:25:51.276 --> 01:25:54.152
I tell ya, I can't deny it

01:25:55.738 --> 01:25:57.614
I thought of quitting, baby

01:25:58.867 --> 01:26:01.410
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it

01:26:01.494 --> 01:26:04.955
And if I didn't think
It was worth one single try

01:26:07.709 --> 01:26:08.792
Coming.

01:26:08.877 --> 01:26:12.421
I'd jump right on a big bird
And then I'd fly...

01:26:19.888 --> 01:26:21.305
Hey, Arthur.

01:26:21.472 --> 01:26:22.472
How's it going?

01:26:23.474 --> 01:26:24.766
Oh, hey, guys.

01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:26.435
Come on in.

01:26:26.895 --> 01:26:28.020
Did you get a new gig?

01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:29.730
No.

01:26:30.648 --> 01:26:33.692
Oh, you must be going down to
that rally at City Hall.

01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:35.527
I hear it's gonna be nuts.

01:26:35.695 --> 01:26:37.279
Oh, is that today?

01:26:37.989 --> 01:26:38.989
Yeah.

01:26:39.908 --> 01:26:41.325
What's with the makeup then?

01:26:42.785 --> 01:26:44.286
My mom died.

01:26:44.454 --> 01:26:45.662
I'm celebrating.

01:26:46.581 --> 01:26:47.581
Right. We heard.

01:26:47.749 --> 01:26:48.790
That's why we came by.

01:26:48.958 --> 01:26:51.668
We figured, you know, you
could use some cheering up.

01:26:52.211 --> 01:26:53.837
Aw, that's sweet.

01:26:54.005 --> 01:26:56.882
But, no, I feel good.

01:26:57.675 --> 01:26:59.301
Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.

01:26:59.469 --> 01:27:01.094
I feel a lot better now.

01:27:03.222 --> 01:27:05.724
Oh, okay. Good for you.

01:27:07.852 --> 01:27:10.729
So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,

01:27:10.897 --> 01:27:13.315
but the cops have been coming
around the shop,

01:27:14.067 --> 01:27:17.986
talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.

01:27:18.112 --> 01:27:19.905
- And, um...
- They didn't talk to me.

01:27:21.866 --> 01:27:24.534
That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.

01:27:25.078 --> 01:27:27.579
If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.

01:27:33.378 --> 01:27:34.628
Anyway, um,

01:27:34.796 --> 01:27:38.799
Hoyt said
that they talked to you,

01:27:38.967 --> 01:27:40.258
and now they're looking for me,

01:27:40.343 --> 01:27:41.927
and I just wanna know
what you said.

01:27:42.095 --> 01:27:43.512
Make sure our stories line up.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.723
- Seeing as how you're my boy.
- Yeah, that's important.

01:27:46.891 --> 01:27:48.702
- That makes a lot of sense.
- You know what I mean?

01:27:48.726 --> 01:27:50.394
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

01:27:56.192 --> 01:27:57.192
Arthur!

01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:59.194
No!

01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:01.530
What?

01:28:02.865 --> 01:28:03.865
No!

01:28:11.791 --> 01:28:13.875
Why would you do that, Arthur?

01:28:34.939 --> 01:28:37.107
Do you watch
The Murray Franklin Show?

01:28:37.191 --> 01:28:38.608
Yeah.

01:28:39.944 --> 01:28:41.737
I'm gonna be on tonight.

01:28:46.034 --> 01:28:47.784
It fucking crazy, innit?

01:28:47.869 --> 01:28:49.703
Me on the telly.

01:28:51.748 --> 01:28:53.707
What the fuck, Arthur?

01:28:54.959 --> 01:28:56.043
What?

01:29:01.049 --> 01:29:02.257
It's okay, Gary.

01:29:02.717 --> 01:29:03.717
You can go.

01:29:06.304 --> 01:29:07.929
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:29:10.892 --> 01:29:12.350
Oh!

01:29:12.602 --> 01:29:14.686
Don't look. Just go.

01:29:27.241 --> 01:29:28.241
Fuck.

01:29:33.539 --> 01:29:34.706
Hey, Arthur?

01:29:34.874 --> 01:29:35.874
Yeah?

01:29:37.085 --> 01:29:39.503
Arthur, can you get the lock?

01:29:42.715 --> 01:29:43.715
Shit.

01:29:44.175 --> 01:29:45.634
Sorry, Gary.

01:29:56.604 --> 01:29:57.646
Gary?

01:29:57.814 --> 01:29:58.814
Yeah.

01:30:01.359 --> 01:30:03.944
You were the only one
that was ever nice to me.

01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:07.239
Skedaddle.

01:31:34.452 --> 01:31:35.785
Hey, Arthur!

01:31:35.953 --> 01:31:37.329
We need to talk.

01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:38.705
Oh!

01:31:38.789 --> 01:31:40.790
Hey! Stop, Arthur!

01:31:46.214 --> 01:31:47.297
Arthur!

01:31:49.884 --> 01:31:51.509
Watch it!
Out of the way!

01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:55.680
Move!

01:31:57.683 --> 01:31:58.723
Arthur!

01:31:59.727 --> 01:32:00.977
Shit.

01:32:03.356 --> 01:32:04.439
Hey! Hey!

01:32:11.489 --> 01:32:12.489
Arthur, stop!

01:32:18.204 --> 01:32:19.204
Go! Go!

01:32:21.332 --> 01:32:23.332
Now
departing, O-Train, downtown.

01:32:25.169 --> 01:32:26.920
Stand clear of
the closing doors.

01:32:36.347 --> 01:32:38.974
Hold that train! Hold it!

01:32:40.893 --> 01:32:42.102
Get out! Get outta here!

01:32:43.229 --> 01:32:44.869
Next stop, Bedford Park.

01:32:59.245 --> 01:33:00.245
Masks off!

01:33:00.413 --> 01:33:01.788
Get your mask off!

01:33:02.623 --> 01:33:04.374
Signs down! Now!

01:33:13.551 --> 01:33:15.010
Police! Signs down!

01:33:16.178 --> 01:33:17.262
Signs down.

01:33:21.976 --> 01:33:23.143
What the fuck!

01:33:26.063 --> 01:33:27.623
Beat his ass!

01:33:33.988 --> 01:33:35.530
Stop fighting! Police!

01:33:35.698 --> 01:33:37.824
Police! Get down!

01:33:39.994 --> 01:33:42.120
Get down! Get the fuck back!

01:33:43.205 --> 01:33:44.205
Police! Get down.

01:33:45.124 --> 01:33:46.249
Get the fuck down!

01:33:50.963 --> 01:33:53.381
Stay the fuck back! Down!

01:33:57.011 --> 01:33:58.011
What the...

01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:02.390
Arthur!

01:34:02.975 --> 01:34:04.017
Burke!

01:34:05.644 --> 01:34:07.103
Don't do it!

01:34:56.946 --> 01:34:58.113
Two officers on the train

01:34:58.197 --> 01:34:59.717
were violently confronted
by the crowd,

01:34:59.782 --> 01:35:01.199
and tonight are in serious

01:35:01.283 --> 01:35:03.493
but stable condition
at Gotham Metropolitan.

01:35:03.577 --> 01:35:05.161
We're going live now to

01:35:05.246 --> 01:35:07.038
co-anchor Courtney Weathers,

01:35:07.206 --> 01:35:09.206
who's standing by outside
the Bedford Park Station,

01:35:09.291 --> 01:35:11.126
near where the shooting
took place.

01:35:11.293 --> 01:35:13.169
Courtney,
what's the scene there?

01:35:18.175 --> 01:35:19.217
Murray.

01:35:19.385 --> 01:35:20.969
Hey, hey, hey.
It's Mr. Franklin, buddy.

01:35:21.137 --> 01:35:23.513
Oh, come on, Gene.
That's all bullshit.

01:35:24.598 --> 01:35:25.807
Thank you, Murray.

01:35:27.017 --> 01:35:28.768
I feel like I know you.

01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:31.104
I've been watching you forever.

01:35:31.272 --> 01:35:32.397
Thank you.

01:35:32.565 --> 01:35:33.857
What's with the face?

01:35:34.024 --> 01:35:35.984
I mean,
are you part of the protest?

01:35:36.152 --> 01:35:37.152
No.

01:35:37.319 --> 01:35:39.070
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:41.364
I don't believe in anything.

01:35:41.991 --> 01:35:43.533
I just thought
it'd be good for my act.

01:35:43.701 --> 01:35:45.201
For your act? Didn't you hear

01:35:45.286 --> 01:35:46.763
what happened on the subway?
Some clown got killed.

01:35:46.787 --> 01:35:48.473
He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.

01:35:48.497 --> 01:35:49.747
No, I hadn't heard.

01:35:50.207 --> 01:35:51.291
- Yeah.
- You see?

01:35:51.375 --> 01:35:52.769
This is what I'm telling you.
The audience is gonna go crazy

01:35:52.793 --> 01:35:53.793
if you put this guy on.

01:35:53.919 --> 01:35:56.045
Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

01:35:56.213 --> 01:35:58.423
Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

01:35:59.216 --> 01:36:01.296
We're gonna go with it.

01:36:01.552 --> 01:36:02.552
Thank you, Murray.

01:36:03.137 --> 01:36:04.262
Couple rules, though.

01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:06.181
No cursing.
No off-color material.

01:36:06.348 --> 01:36:07.807
We do a clean show.

01:36:07.975 --> 01:36:08.975
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:36:09.143 --> 01:36:10.727
You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.

01:36:10.895 --> 01:36:11.895
I love Dr. Sally.

01:36:12.062 --> 01:36:13.480
Good, good. Someone will

01:36:13.564 --> 01:36:15.732
- come and get you, okay?
- Okay. Perfect.

01:36:15.816 --> 01:36:16.941
Good luck.

01:36:17.026 --> 01:36:18.026
- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.

01:36:19.236 --> 01:36:22.447
- Murray, one small thing.
- Yeah.

01:36:22.615 --> 01:36:24.282
When you bring me out,

01:36:24.450 --> 01:36:26.326
can you introduce me as Joker?

01:36:26.494 --> 01:36:28.203
What's wrong
with your real name?

01:36:28.829 --> 01:36:31.080
That's what you called me
on the show.

01:36:31.248 --> 01:36:32.373
A joker.

01:36:32.541 --> 01:36:33.541
Do you remember?

01:36:33.918 --> 01:36:35.919
- Did I?
- I don't know.

01:36:36.086 --> 01:36:38.171
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, Joker it is.

01:36:38.339 --> 01:36:39.339
It's good.

01:36:39.507 --> 01:36:40.590
Thanks, Murray.

01:37:02.863 --> 01:37:03.965
I'll try it, you know,

01:37:03.989 --> 01:37:05.865
but I'm not sure
my wife will let me do it.

01:37:07.326 --> 01:37:08.660
Maybe my next wife.

01:37:12.373 --> 01:37:14.123
You gotta see
our next guest for yourself.

01:37:14.291 --> 01:37:16.334
I'm pretty sure
this guy could use a doctor.

01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:17.729
Oh!

01:37:17.753 --> 01:37:19.128
Does he have sexual problems?

01:37:19.296 --> 01:37:21.714
Oh, he looks like
he's got a lot of problems.

01:37:22.925 --> 01:37:25.552
All right, Bobby, let's show
that clip one last time.

01:37:31.976 --> 01:37:34.852
I hated school as a kid.

01:37:36.647 --> 01:37:38.815
But my mother would always say,

01:37:39.858 --> 01:37:41.169
"You should enjoy it.

01:37:41.193 --> 01:37:44.320
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

01:37:44.488 --> 01:37:45.715
"No, I won't, Ma.

01:37:45.739 --> 01:37:47.699
I'm gonna be a comedian."

01:37:53.998 --> 01:37:56.291
Okay. You may...

01:37:57.751 --> 01:38:01.004
You may have seen that clip
of our next guest.

01:38:01.171 --> 01:38:03.548
Now, before he comes out,
I just want to say

01:38:03.716 --> 01:38:05.216
that we're all heartbroken

01:38:05.301 --> 01:38:07.260
about what's going on
in the city tonight.

01:38:07.428 --> 01:38:09.721
But this is
how he wanted to come out,

01:38:09.888 --> 01:38:13.099
and honestly, I think
we could all use a good laugh.

01:38:13.267 --> 01:38:15.435
So, please welcome, Joker.

01:38:24.101 --> 01:38:33.349

Insta: @Dream_Ports / @Magic_Ports

01:38:58.062 --> 01:38:59.437
Are you all right, Doctor?

01:39:03.275 --> 01:39:05.735
Well,
that was quite an entrance.

01:39:12.284 --> 01:39:13.284
You okay?

01:39:16.121 --> 01:39:17.538
Yeah.

01:39:17.706 --> 01:39:20.416
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

01:39:22.378 --> 01:39:24.170
Well, that makes one of us.

01:39:31.053 --> 01:39:33.221
So, can you tell us
about this look?

01:39:33.389 --> 01:39:34.722
When we spoke earlier,

01:39:34.807 --> 01:39:36.910
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.

01:39:36.934 --> 01:39:37.975
Is that right?

01:39:38.143 --> 01:39:39.769
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

01:39:39.937 --> 01:39:42.480
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

01:39:42.648 --> 01:39:44.728
And how's that going for you?

01:39:52.741 --> 01:39:54.575
So, I know you're a comedian.

01:39:54.743 --> 01:39:56.577
You been working on
any new material?

01:39:56.662 --> 01:39:57.787
You wanna tell us a joke?

01:40:03.502 --> 01:40:04.502
Yeah?

01:40:06.672 --> 01:40:07.672
Okay.

01:40:13.721 --> 01:40:15.346
He's got a book.

01:40:16.265 --> 01:40:17.724
A book of jokes.

01:40:27.568 --> 01:40:28.943
Take your time.
We got all night.

01:40:34.992 --> 01:40:37.285
Okay, okay. Here's one.

01:40:40.414 --> 01:40:42.915
Knock, knock.

01:40:43.083 --> 01:40:44.417
And you had to look that up?

01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:53.176
I want to get it right.

01:40:55.012 --> 01:40:56.554
Knock, knock.

01:40:56.722 --> 01:40:58.222
Who's there?

01:40:59.683 --> 01:41:01.100
It's the police, ma'am.

01:41:01.268 --> 01:41:03.102
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.

01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:05.688
He's dead.

01:41:07.608 --> 01:41:09.192
Oh, no, no, no.

01:41:09.359 --> 01:41:11.110
No, you cannot joke about that.

01:41:11.278 --> 01:41:13.237
Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

01:41:13.405 --> 01:41:15.865
That's not the kind of humor
we do on this show.

01:41:16.450 --> 01:41:18.743
Okay. I'm... Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:41:18.911 --> 01:41:23.289
It's just, you know, it's been
a rough few weeks, Murray.

01:41:24.875 --> 01:41:26.709
Ever since

01:41:29.254 --> 01:41:31.380
I killed
those three Wall Street guys.

01:41:37.971 --> 01:41:39.931
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punchline.

01:41:41.433 --> 01:41:43.142
There is no punchline.

01:41:44.561 --> 01:41:46.437
It's not a joke.

01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:52.193
You're serious, aren't you?

01:41:52.361 --> 01:41:53.421
You're telling us you killed

01:41:53.445 --> 01:41:54.714
those three young men
on the subway?

01:41:54.738 --> 01:41:55.738
Mmm-hmm.

01:41:55.906 --> 01:41:57.615
And why should we believe you?

01:41:57.783 --> 01:41:59.742
I got nothing left to lose.

01:42:01.745 --> 01:42:03.788
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

01:42:06.959 --> 01:42:09.836
My life is nothing but a comedy.

01:42:13.465 --> 01:42:14.567
Well, let me get this straight,

01:42:14.591 --> 01:42:16.843
you think that killing
those guys is funny?

01:42:17.511 --> 01:42:19.011
I do.

01:42:19.179 --> 01:42:21.806
And I'm tired
of pretending it's not.

01:42:21.974 --> 01:42:23.850
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

01:42:24.309 --> 01:42:26.018
Isn't that what they say?

01:42:26.186 --> 01:42:27.937
All of you,

01:42:28.105 --> 01:42:30.690
the system that knows so much,

01:42:30.858 --> 01:42:33.568
you decide
what's right or wrong.

01:42:33.735 --> 01:42:38.948
The same way that you decide
what's funny or not!

01:42:40.284 --> 01:42:41.284
Get him off!

01:42:42.035 --> 01:42:45.705
Well, okay,
I think I might understand

01:42:46.039 --> 01:42:47.540
that you did this to
start a movement,

01:42:47.624 --> 01:42:49.625
to become a symbol?

01:42:50.252 --> 01:42:51.794
Come on, Murray.

01:42:51.962 --> 01:42:53.189
Do I look like the kind of clown

01:42:53.213 --> 01:42:54.797
that could start a movement?

01:42:54.965 --> 01:42:57.800
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

01:42:57.968 --> 01:43:00.469
Everybody is awful these days.

01:43:00.637 --> 01:43:02.930
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

01:43:03.098 --> 01:43:04.849
Okay. So, that's it,
you're crazy.

01:43:05.017 --> 01:43:07.310
That's your defense
for killing three young men?

01:43:07.936 --> 01:43:09.478
No.

01:43:09.646 --> 01:43:12.982
They couldn't carry a tune
to save their lives.

01:43:14.818 --> 01:43:18.237
Oh, why is everybody
so upset about these guys?

01:43:19.114 --> 01:43:20.865
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

01:43:20.949 --> 01:43:22.325
you'd walk right over me!

01:43:22.492 --> 01:43:24.619
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.

01:43:24.786 --> 01:43:27.038
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne

01:43:27.122 --> 01:43:28.664
went and cried about them on TV?

01:43:28.832 --> 01:43:30.875
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

01:43:31.043 --> 01:43:32.960
Yes, I do.

01:43:33.128 --> 01:43:36.547
Have you seen what it's like
out there, Murray?

01:43:36.715 --> 01:43:39.759
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

01:43:39.927 --> 01:43:43.763
Everybody just yells
and screams at each other.

01:43:43.931 --> 01:43:46.098
Nobody's civil anymore.

01:43:46.266 --> 01:43:49.852
Nobody thinks what it's like
to be the other guy.

01:43:50.646 --> 01:43:53.439
You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think

01:43:53.523 --> 01:43:55.483
what it's like to be
someone like me?

01:43:55.651 --> 01:43:58.361
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

01:43:58.570 --> 01:44:00.696
They think that
we'll just sit there

01:44:00.781 --> 01:44:03.157
and take it,
like good little boys!

01:44:03.450 --> 01:44:05.534
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!

01:44:05.702 --> 01:44:07.328
You finished?

01:44:07.496 --> 01:44:09.830
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.

01:44:09.998 --> 01:44:11.540
You sound like
you're making excuses

01:44:11.625 --> 01:44:13.042
for killing those young men.

01:44:13.210 --> 01:44:15.044
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,

01:44:15.128 --> 01:44:16.545
not everyone is awful.

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:20.049
You're awful, Murray.

01:44:20.217 --> 01:44:22.093
Me? I'm awful?

01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:24.011
Oh, yeah, how am I awful?

01:44:26.181 --> 01:44:27.640
Playing my video.

01:44:29.059 --> 01:44:30.935
Inviting me on this show.

01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:34.355
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

01:44:35.357 --> 01:44:37.316
You're just like
the rest of them.

01:44:37.484 --> 01:44:39.402
You don't know
the first thing about me, pal.

01:44:39.569 --> 01:44:42.154
Look what happened, because of
what you did. What it led to.

01:44:42.322 --> 01:44:44.031
There are riots out there.

01:44:44.199 --> 01:44:45.718
Two policemen are
in critical condition,

01:44:45.742 --> 01:44:47.011
and you're laughing.

01:44:47.035 --> 01:44:48.035
You're laughing.

01:44:48.203 --> 01:44:51.038
Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.

01:44:51.206 --> 01:44:52.665
I know.

01:44:55.252 --> 01:44:56.492
How about another joke, Murray?

01:44:56.628 --> 01:44:58.308
No, I think we've had
enough of your jokes.

01:44:58.422 --> 01:44:59.774
- What do you get...
- I don't think so.

01:44:59.798 --> 01:45:02.341
When you cross
a mentally-ill loner

01:45:02.509 --> 01:45:04.927
with a society that abandons him

01:45:05.012 --> 01:45:06.053
and treats him like trash?

01:45:06.221 --> 01:45:07.221
Call the police, Gene!

01:45:07.389 --> 01:45:08.825
- I'll tell you what you get!
- Call the police.

01:45:08.849 --> 01:45:10.516
You get
what you fucking deserve!

01:45:47.054 --> 01:45:50.181
Good night.
And always remember, that's...

01:45:55.562 --> 01:45:56.812
Breaking news.

01:45:56.980 --> 01:45:59.523
Popular TV talk show host,
Murray Franklin

01:45:59.691 --> 01:46:01.961
was shot dead tonight on the
live telecast of his program.

01:46:01.985 --> 01:46:04.278
The man who was
introduced by Franklin

01:46:04.362 --> 01:46:07.239
as "Joker" is
currently under arrest.

01:46:07.407 --> 01:46:09.992
Police led the suspect
handcuffed out of the studio.

01:46:11.745 --> 01:46:14.288
Merely just a punchline
to a joke...

01:46:14.456 --> 01:46:16.096
You get what you
deserve!

01:46:16.208 --> 01:46:17.310
Looting and rioting

01:46:17.334 --> 01:46:18.375
have intensified here...

01:46:18.543 --> 01:46:20.021
...rioting
throughout the city.

01:46:20.045 --> 01:46:21.355
...with a society
that abandons him

01:46:21.379 --> 01:46:22.421
and treats him like trash?

01:46:22.506 --> 01:46:23.775
This mob of clowns...

01:46:23.799 --> 01:46:25.359
many wearing clown masks.

01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:28.980
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

01:46:29.012 --> 01:46:30.406
- you'd walk right over me.
- To all of

01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:31.908
those who have been
ignored by the system.

01:46:31.932 --> 01:46:33.201
And always remember,
that's life!

01:46:33.225 --> 01:46:35.893
And as you see,
Gotham is burning.

01:46:37.354 --> 01:46:41.524
In the white room
With black curtains near the station

01:46:45.028 --> 01:46:49.990
Black roof country, no gold pavements
Tired starlings

01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:56.705
Silver horses ran down moonbeams

01:46:58.834 --> 01:47:00.876
In your dark eyes

01:47:02.879 --> 01:47:08.968
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving
My contentment

01:47:14.266 --> 01:47:18.269
I'll wait in this place
Where the sun never shines

01:47:21.106 --> 01:47:24.275
Wait in this place

01:47:24.359 --> 01:47:29.905
Where the shadows run from themselves

01:47:31.116 --> 01:47:33.316
Stop laughing,
you freak! This isn't funny.

01:47:33.743 --> 01:47:35.054
Yeah, the whole
fucking city's on fire

01:47:35.078 --> 01:47:36.078
'cause of what you did.

01:47:37.289 --> 01:47:39.582
All units,
fire reported, north of alley.

01:47:39.666 --> 01:47:41.208
Code Four for medical.

01:47:41.835 --> 01:47:43.294
I know.

01:47:44.796 --> 01:47:46.797
Isn't it beautiful?

01:49:29.276 --> 01:49:30.609
Go over there.

01:49:48.503 --> 01:49:49.628
Hey, Wayne.

01:49:50.588 --> 01:49:52.339
You get
what you fucking deserve.

01:49:52.507 --> 01:49:53.632
No! Pal!

01:50:34.424 --> 01:50:36.425
Come on, get up!

01:50:36.593 --> 01:50:38.552
Come on, man, get up.

01:53:17.754 --> 01:53:19.838
What's so funny?

01:53:23.843 --> 01:53:25.427
Just thinking of a joke.

01:53:44.614 --> 01:53:46.615
Do you want to tell it to me?

01:53:52.789 --> 01:53:54.414
You wouldn't get it.

01:54:06.469 --> 01:54:08.136
That's life

01:54:08.221 --> 01:54:09.680
That's life

01:54:09.764 --> 01:54:12.683
And as funny as it may seem

01:54:14.143 --> 01:54:16.853
Some people get their kicks

01:54:17.021 --> 01:54:19.147
Stompin' on a dream

01:54:20.191 --> 01:54:23.860
But I don't let it,
let it get me down

01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:28.198
'Cause this fine old world

01:54:28.324 --> 01:54:30.909
It keeps spinnin' around

01:54:31.661 --> 01:54:34.955
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate

01:54:35.039 --> 01:54:38.292
A poet, a pawn and a king

01:54:38.376 --> 01:54:42.337
I've been up and down and over and out

01:54:42.422 --> 01:54:44.590
And I know one thing

01:54:44.924 --> 01:54:50.762
Each time I find myself flat on my face

01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:57.227
I pick myself up
And get back in the race

01:54:57.604 --> 01:54:58.812
That's life

01:54:58.896 --> 01:54:59.980
That's life

01:55:00.064 --> 01:55:04.109
That's life
And I can't deny it

01:55:04.819 --> 01:55:10.073
Many times I thought of cuttin' out
But my heart won't buy it

01:55:10.658 --> 01:55:15.245
But if there's nothing shakin'
Come here this July

01:55:18.207 --> 01:55:24.379
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball

01:55:24.881 --> 01:55:31.094
And die

01:55:32.889 --> 01:55:38.727
My, my

01:55:50.114 --> 01:55:52.616
Isn't it rich?

01:55:54.952 --> 01:55:57.746
Are we a pair?

01:55:59.791 --> 01:56:03.585
Me here at last on the ground

01:56:03.836 --> 01:56:07.089
You in mid-air

01:56:09.133 --> 01:56:13.762
Send in the clowns

01:56:20.561 --> 01:56:23.105
Isn't it bliss?

01:56:25.983 --> 01:56:29.319
Don't you approve?

01:56:30.988 --> 01:56:34.658
One who keeps tearing around

01:56:34.742 --> 01:56:38.912
One who can't move

01:56:41.874 --> 01:56:47.087
Where are the clowns?

01:56:48.381 --> 01:56:52.217
Send in the clowns

01:56:53.177 --> 01:56:55.929
Just when I stopped

01:56:57.432 --> 01:57:00.600
Opening doors

01:57:02.353 --> 01:57:09.025
Finally knowing
The one that I wanted was yours

01:57:11.154 --> 01:57:17.826
Making my entrance again
With my usual flair

01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:26.042
Sure of my lines

01:57:27.795 --> 01:57:32.758
No one is there

01:57:40.141 --> 01:57:44.144
Don't you love farce?

01:57:46.939 --> 01:57:49.983
My fault, I fear

01:57:52.445 --> 01:57:56.490
I thought that you'd
want what I want

01:57:56.574 --> 01:58:00.243
Sorry, my dear

01:58:02.538 --> 01:58:07.209
But where are the clowns?

01:58:09.545 --> 01:58:14.508
There ought to be clowns

01:58:15.676 --> 01:58:22.641
Well, maybe next year
